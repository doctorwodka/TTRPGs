<p>Onarach was born to a single working mother in a run down home in a small town. The two weren’t necessarily unhappy with their lot in life, but the cooking job Onarach’s mother worked at left much to be desired in terms of a comfortable livelihood. On the occasions when a rich nobleman or merchant would stop on their way through town, Onarach would take note and ponder the difference between himself and those with means.</p>
<p>This sort of pondering eventually showed itself as his main personality trait and his mother did what she could to encourage his mind to grow. She scavenged discarded books where she could find them, used what money they could spare to buy ink and paper, and taught what she could herself. Onarach never considered it until later in life, but his mother was surprisingly knowledgeable for someone of their class. Maybe his father had taught her or she had a more interesting past than she let on, but she never told him, and he never thought to ask until it was too late. Whatever the case, he was just happy that he could learn about things that interested him.</p>
<p>And nothing interested him more than alchemy. In general, he liked just to make things, but the things one could make with alchemy were the most amazing to Onarach. Potions, elixirs, poisons, explosions… it all enthralled him and he took to alchemy with passion. Eventually, he came of age and his mother managed to secure an apprenticeship for him in a large city about a couple weeks travel from home. He promised to make her proud and support her as much as he could. Maybe one day he would open up his own shop and purchase them a nice comfortable place to live.</p>
<p>In the city, Onarach kept true to his word and set his nose to the grindstone. He rented and lived in a room below his means to save as much money as possible and bought only what was absolutely necessary, sending what he could afford not to save back to his mother at home with his letters. His mother told him that it was unnecessary, but he sent the money all the same. And since he used very little money on himself, he spent most of his free time in libraries, experimenting, and occasionally exploring the wild city.</p>
<p>By the time he was 19, Onarach had gained a few chemical scars, a decent nest egg, and a sharp mind. However, it was around this time when the trickle of letters from his mother had stopped completely. After three months of no reply, he took some time off and went to see her. His childhood home was completely barren and his neighbors informed him that his mother had died of a rare disease. It turns out that she had been hiding her sickness from him for a long time, and although it was curable, the treatment was ridiculously expensive. It seems that she might have sold off everything just to keep it at bay for as long as she could, or at least, that’s what he was told.</p>
<p>In shock and grief, Onarach didn’t really know what to do next. So he just headed back to work. For a while, he did nothing but work, eat, sleep, and think about how all his past problems could have been solved, were he only born rich… Living life, he came to speculate, was in itself a goal and aspiration to aim for. But being wealthy can greatly increase one’s longevity and ability to enjoy all aspects of life. After all, money could afford him books, experimentation supplies, quality apprenticeship, quick passage home, life-saving medicine, and even magical/alchemical ways of extending his life. With the way he was now and the amount of life he had probably had left, he couldn’t even hope to have enough time to become as wealthy as he needed to be in order to really “live” life… Not unless he could find a ludicrously profitable way of getting rich quick or a secret way to significantly extend his lifespan.</p>
<p>All this he pondered in the cold logical space of his grief as he went through the daily motions, like an automaton, for several months after the news of his mother’s death. But then, like a sign from the gods, Onarach stumbled upon a rumor about a secret alchemical concoction that could potentially provide the user with indefinite youthful health. It was hidden in the footnote of an old, disused library book, and the rumor was dubious at best, but it gave him all the reason he needed.</p>
<p>Onarach quit his job, took his alchemical gear, and abandoned society for the woods. Telling himself that the reason he was running to the woods was to get rid of distraction, he found a good spot with not too many dangers around and a nice little stream nearby and set to work.</p>
<p>It was tough going. Onarach had very little experience with the wild before and nearly died several times for minor mistakes. But eventually, he became a seasoned woodsman over the course of nearly twenty years as he worked on discovering a formula for an elixir of youth, out in the woods. Much of his experimenting quite literally blew up in his face. He never seemed to make any progress with the youth potion, but at the very least, he had several new explosive ways of keeping wild animals at bay. And while he had become very cynical about society as a whole, he could never really disengage himself fully from it. After all, society had books, and good alchemical supplies, and entertainment. Trips back to town were a regular occurrence. On one of his trips, he even ended up buying a canine companion which would both help him hunt and keep him company.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, Onarach’s stagnation got to him. He had made next to no progress on an elixir of eternal youth in twenty years and the lack of new experience was positively mind-numbing. So he decided to finally pull himself together and reintegrate into society with the express purpose of pursuing his dual, co-dependent goals of obtaining wealth and the secret to youthful immortality.</p>
<p>And with that, it has been a year since Onarach had left the forest. He now wanders the continent, going from town to city selling his alchemical wares, saving money, finding new formulas, looking for new experiences, and searching for any information on the elixir of youth.</p>
