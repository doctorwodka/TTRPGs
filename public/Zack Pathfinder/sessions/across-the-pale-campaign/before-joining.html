<p>We found the <a data-href="Dragon Temple" href="places/mundi-memoriae/frethïar/markier/dragon-temple.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Temple</a>, has sings of proto-religions from before the pantheonic religions began to form. More than likely in between the god is a force of nature and god is a personification stage. The symbols belong to an old symbol of the axis before modern understanding, more aligned to the side of chaos. Temple seemed to be dedicated to dragons – if theres a dragon like being here it would probably be in the inner sanctum. Coatls are not extinct in our home world but they are here. Undead monastic armored dude. The temple of the divine conversion of the coatl – likely where they transform the coatl into dragons.</p>
