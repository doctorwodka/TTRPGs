href=\"misc/groups/grove-druids.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Grove Druids</a>SPOILERS Notable history (that church knows): Was first seen in public after the necromancer Caius was attacked in his home, resulting in the building nearly burning completely to the ground. <br>Reports of seeing him (lost and confused, often mistaken for <a data-href=\"Caius Thaine\" href=\"npcs/chosen-by-gods-npcs/caius-thaine.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Caius Thaine</a>) went as far as northern <a data-href=\"Barrenbreak\" href=\"places/avasoryd/barrenbreak/barrenbreak.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Barrenbreak</a>. Put up a Huge Fight when the Church went to capture him, but he begrudgingly settled down when he found out they weren't attacking him. Public religious beliefs: \"The Church's beliefs are like, fine, I guess?\" says local man who slogged through several old ass books repeating the same story over and over again. He's knowledgable enough about the story that he can discuss with others who fully believe in what the Church believes at length. Private beliefs: The gods may represent different aspects of the world, but they clearly don't intervene where they should. He's still not 100% certain that the gods even actually exist and his Nex Umbra mark isn't just an elaborate setup by some sort of wizard. Time since capture: Roughly 2 years Important family and friends: <br><a data-href=\"Caius Thaine\" href=\"npcs/chosen-by-gods-npcs/caius-thaine.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Caius Thaine</a> - A necromancer who shares almost the exact same features as Sinani, almost as if they were reflections of each other. 5'11\"\nBlonde hair that falls just below his shoulders\nSeveral moles across his face\nPale grey eyes\nLooks like he hasn't seen the sun in weeks Dreams and aspirations: Stopping the rise of necromancy (as someone who has seen a necromancer in action) Expand his (modern) knowledge of the world Stop being put in Caius' shadow/fix the problems he caused Find out what Solace's connection to Nex Umbra is and why he was chosen How old are you:\n- Physically, like, 25.\n- Actual is like 2.5\nFinally get a chance to rest and really delve into what his new meaning for existence is. He wants to understand why Solace came to him with the mark from Nex Umbra. He wants to learn more about the world, more than what would be found in largely outdated books. What would your character be doing if they were not on this adventure? Likely trying to rally the people from under Caius to deal with him/his lackies. Probably wouldn't go very well due to the Sharing The Same Face situation, but, hey, most people haven't seen Caius face to face before! Why aren't they doing that now? It's better with friends and not endangering the general population :) Where are they from? Fallencall Who were they to the community they were from? <br>Caius's body double, somebody not needed until the Worst Possible Outcome happened to the <a data-href=\"Blackfrost\" href=\"misc/groups/blackfrost.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Blackfrost</a>. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? <br>A young elven woman named <a data-href=\"Rima Dahast\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rima Dahast</a> was the first person who helped him in the Church. As a cleric of Aos Baia, she was quite kind in introducing him into the Church and answered any questions he had. He's not entirely sure what she's been up to, but presumably she's still with the Chuch. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Meeting Solace! :3\nEscaping Caius and seeing the Real World and how it's drastically different than what he was led to believe, only to be snatched back up by the Church.\nLearning about the Blackfrost plague and the people dying to it. What’s your characters goal? Stopping Caius and preventing the spread of the Blackfrost and finding out why he was chosen by Nex Umbra. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? I wanted to play a character who's able to settle into his own skin and create a name for himself rather than be in someone else's shadow. I really like the concept of the \"twin\" of such an evil guy is actively going against him despite unintentionally taking advantage of the fact that they share a face to do so. I also really want to learn more about what the mirror realm entails and why the FUCK they are sending these beasts to fight these reflections. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? Big big dammy from Solace, while still being able to cast spells. :3 I like the concept of kind of being the martial and the support caster all in one From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? Due to being \"born\" from a reflection, he wasn't able to defeat Solace and instead accepted this strange mirror beast as his summons. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Arcana due to essentially being a wizard's apprentice for a little while, and has since tried to absorb as much information on the magical arts to try and understand what the FUCK is going on in the world magically\nAthletics is from having to fucking BOOK IT whenever there had been the chance he was gonna get snatched up, and is now like. Okay. I guess I should actually try to not let them grab me like that again Intimidation is due to the fear the Blackfrost puts into people, which he's using by, yknow, sharing his face Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? The dead shouldn't be desecrated, especially if they're normal people caught in the crossfire of stronger adventurers. (Korkau has been REALLY pushing this for him. Very uncomfortable with their Dead Snatching.) Lying &amp; hiding the truth is okay, unless it actively puts others in immediate danger. Murder under self-defense is fine, but if you're just killing to kill you're not really... going to be on his good side. Magic is power. Those who have magic should be trying to help those who don't, and if you're not, you should have a good reason. His friends or innocents would have to have be being threatened for him to go against his morals. However, he's quicker to cave if his own life is directly on the chopping block. He still wants to live. He wants to learn and grow. Would Sin ever consider changing their face? Honestly? Yes. If given the chance, he's have his face changed permanently so he doesn't have to face the comparisons to Caius ever again. Who were they to the community when they traveled? The odd guy with a giant tiger who, despite it, shrunk away from strangers at first. Eventually, he did open up to those who probed a bit, and he was more than willing to help out when needed. Never stuck around long, though, and did seem to be looking over his shoulder at any possible moment as if he was worried he was being watched. Where did they travel before the church got them? As far south as the northernmost tip of the Lunahelm Raiders. Without a map or worldly experience, it's kind of hard to get anywhere, really. Which, in hindsight, is probably for the best since he probably wouldn't have been a good fit there. Tell me about your time as a wizards apprentice He was overseen as he was taught how to work on cadavers by various Blackfrost workers. Elbows deep in rotting carcasses, only to later see them mindlessly walking to the Blackfrosts' orders. He was terrible at the actual raising part of necromancy, which was definitely... not ideal, but not the worst; at least he had some magical ability. He couldn't imagine what they would have had him do if he didn't have Solace. What happened before you escaped? He tried to learn about the world as much as he could. Half of the information went right over his head, but when he wasn't being forced into doing anything, he was sneaking books, or speaking with Solace, or probing the Blackfrost lackies for information. How did you escape? He took full advantage of the attack to hide Solace and sneak away in the heat of the moment. Stolen cloak and knife, the dark of night, and wandering blindly until he found a passage that was probably supposed to be under guard and he was... out. It shocked him, too. He spent all night running away until he hid in some poor family's barn to sleep. He couldn't shake the feeling that they let him escape but... he's yet to find proof of tht. Did you get to know any members of the Blackfrost? Very few Blackfrost members actually treated him more than some soulless husk for Lord Caius. Some were mean when he asked questions. Some were nice. The very, very few actually pitied him into speaking with him like a human being. The closest he got to know was a halfling called Len. He's not sure if that was a nickname or his actual name, but Len treated him the most like a person. That doesn't mean he was treated well, but he was still treated like he had thoughts and opinions outside of Caius's own. Len was there because he was promised sanctuary from local law if he helped Lord Caius. Sinani managed to gleam that he did something quite bad but Len never let slip what exactly he did. What’s the worst thing sin would do to survive? <br>\nGive up Solace, part of his soul, even it hurt him in the end (and by god it would hurt both of them). Go back to the <a data-href=\"Blackfrost\" href=\"misc/groups/blackfrost.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Blackfrost</a>, if things went truly to hell. Would sin get rid of sol if given the chance? Probably not unless he had very good reason to. Sinani's gotten pretty attached to Solace, even despite the \"magically attached to his soul\" part.

alt=\"cecylia.png\" src=\"attachments/cecylia.png\" target=\"_self\">19\nBirthday: 22nd of Baiary, 618SPOILERS Where are they from? <br>She's a runaway from a small farming community called <a data-href=\"Bredani\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/fallencall/bredani.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bredani</a> in south east <a data-href=\"Fallencall\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fallencall</a>. She was never a farmer, and she was never that good in the arcane magics, so her and her collection of trinkets and doodads were never... appreciated, she thought. Who were they to the community they were from? The little kid who'd rather dig through junk than help out. She's sweet, yeah, but you have to drag her out of the house and physically put her in the field to get her to do anything and even then she obviously hates doing it. She's basically just a child, and now she's run away. With Idris, she was just chatty little sidekick that followed him around and seemed to get on his nerves. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? <br><a data-href=\"Idris Lanthorn\" href=\"npcs/former-pcs/idris-lanthorn/idris-lanthorn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Idris Lanthorn</a>. He took her in and taught her what he knew for the tools of the trade after she tried to scam him on a piece of junk she found that she knew was worth nothing. He's... well. You know where.\n<br><a data-href=\"Lilika Naas\" href=\"npcs/lilika-naas.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lilika Naas</a>. She's a gnomish woman that Cyl met in her brief time in <a data-href=\"Welterglow\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/welterglow/welterglow.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Welterglow</a>, who had actually spent time in the Swashbuckler Society before taking a small break to be on land. She taught Cyl the bare beginnings of the bardic craft, which she took to like a fish in water. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? The first week of actually living on her own, she hadn't realized how hard it would be. She'd expected it to be hard, but not this hard. One night, she had set up camp, sat down, and just started crying. She missed home, she missed people so bad, and she was this close to packing things back up and heading there. But after she stopped sniffling, she shook her head and promised herself that she'd be okay. That she was going to make her own home somewhere, she'd make friends and her own family, and she'll be okay. What’s your characters goal? Helping those who have been affected by the wizards and protecting them from being hurt once again. Bringing Idris back. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? Learning that she has to actually 'grow up' and realize that she doesn't have to take every little thing on herself. That she can be strong, but she doesn't have to be if there are those willing to help. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? :woozy: Other people not dying. From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? She's no thaumaturge, but she does learn how to take advantage of her voice and knowledge as much as she can. She learnt fighting styles from Idris, and how to properly hold a knife, but she How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Learning from Idris, she's taken her charismatic personality and pushed it further. She's diplomatic, she's deceptive, and of course she can perform. Living on her own, she's been forced to learn how to subsist on the natural world. How does your character view themself? How do others view your character? She thinks she's... okay? She tries really hard! She's doing her best! But she's just... okay.\nChatty, pushy, but overall a nice kid. Needs to figure out what she wants to do in life; she has so many years ahead of her. Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? Edicts: Take the Long Road: Take a long-term perspective in all aspects of life. Uncover the hidden value of every trinket. Anathemas: Forsake Collaboration: Disdaining teamwork, refusing to learn from others, or acting solely for individual glory. Judge worth by surface shine. Rely on others to fight your battles Those she trusted abandon her, they refuse to help her in the resurrection of Idris, or they actively hurt her after she has helped them.

person walking on stilts? It left circular poles as it chased them away This seemed to be some sort of giant. 8 legged creature Slightly before we arrive at the bridge, hear some strange rustling swiftly approaching form the bushes\nCentipedes :( That can speak???\nExperiencing rage\nCentipedes are getting more and more articulate as the fight goes on\nSuper unusual for centipedes to be in the daytime and should also be running away after we killed the 1st centipede in combat\nSeems like the influence of some kind of evil spirit, they have unusual intellect, are aggressive and malicious 10 mins since we woke up, instead of nice summer weather we were expecting, a very strong fog rolls in\nBy the time the river is in sight, its affecting ability to see\nNotice strange shapes moving and shifting around our vision, but when we look, theres nothing there\nShizuka and kavi remember a nursery rhyme <br><img alt=\"monday (1).png\" src=\"attachments/monday-(1).png\" target=\"_self\"> <br><a data-href=\"Spider Gate\" href=\"places/iactaleia/willowshore/spider-gate.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spider Gate</a>!

And what would the wall of fog be anyway?” A curse “For you all.” Are you not affected?\nWe met a guy who went through the mist, he didnt say anything about the promised land “Maybe it goes different places for different people” What happens if you die before you do the ritual? “I assume that i’ll be reborn.” Only you, or can all shapechangers go to the promised land? “I think all? Even non shapechangers. But you might not like it.” Whats so good about it “Many faces to steal. Many things to mimic, itll be normal to mimic things. Many challenges for those who enjoy the killing and stabbing. We will be with the powerful Creator. So. y’know.” Is this in a way not the promised land? “I guess. But IDK if there will be jails int eh promised land.” Yes for traitors. I killed a guy last week.\nIf the promsioed land lets you kill freely, whats to stop you from being killed\nHow many are involved in the ritual? “4 or 5. They switch out. Not many of those in the camp are good at stealing faces. Let alone cast arcane magics. Zhuo-do are the only one who can do divine abilities.”\n“Zhuo-do read his aura and said he was very old.” Youre still believing her? “Yeah. and i ahev to decide between killing and sacrificing. But its my firmly held belief that one of these is the right thing to do.” <br>Do you believe that <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Kugaptee\" data-href=\"Kugaptee\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kugaptee.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the god</a> will protect the people int he camp? “Those worthy, surely.” Then why not have a quick selection, we go there, we die, and only the worthy are left “You can go there. Are you not familiar with the area?” I am <br>“Oh its the <a data-href=\"Lumber Camp\" href=\"places/iactaleia/willowshore/willowshore-hinterlands/lumber-camp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lumber Camp</a>.” Whats worthiness? “He’d say you were worthy. I bet he’d like you on his side. You have a great evil within you.” How many are in your camp? “Like 20?” In the camp or altogether? “In the camp.” How many outside? “We keep having some wander in from the woods, i wanna say like 30? I certainly have trouble believing im the only one in town.” Know anyone else seeking the promised land? “I suppose he’ll be in the camp. The old man. The farmer man.” Do you know whats going on with the people that nobody seems to remember? “I mean. Maybe. The people around them got very scared when people took their face off and forgot?” No, theres empty houses Oh boy zhu has a plan How are you doing “Fine.” Would you like smth to drink “...sure” Give him a bottle\nSomething thats fun when youre passing time, try to balance smth on your head if you would be so kind\nHopefully im not too drunk for this- (needle darts at the bottle)\nKeeps handing him bottles to do this\nDo you- here, i know you want to take a swing at me. Everyone does. “Uh not really.” Listen. I want to continue this game, its fun to drink until i miss. But TBH i dont want to be the one to kill you “Why?” Your friends will do it for me. As you can tell, i am very drunk rn. I came upwith this plan while drunk, so all magic will reveal im truthful\nYou already talked, you gave us info, so youll coordinate with us sooner or alter “Wdym” Answer some questions\nWho exactly has been replaced that you know of? <br>“The old farmer (<a data-href=\"Kum Soon-chong\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kum-soon-chong.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kum Soon-chong</a>.

(divine lance actually aiming at him) “Theres a group northside, but we’ve intentionally not told each other.” Do you know what happens to those who are sacrificed? Those who fail are stuck to people like me. “You have more ghosts than we have sacrificed” You remember reincarnation. What makes your cycle different? “I didnt think i had enough of a soul to be a ghost” You do “So ill be around forever.” People killed by me will be attached to me. Do you think your voice will be understood amongst the others? “Itd be fun” I mostly pee and masturbate, its not fun “I dont do either” You dont urinate? “No, i drink thru my hands and it leaves thru the soles of my feet. How else would it be?” Your patron. Shes a divine caster. Does she have a symbol? “Yyyyes.”\n“She has a book she carries with her at all times. She has… theres of course the shrine. She has a red butterfly?” Ive seen a few of those before.\n(yeah shes a witch. AP overwritten)\nWill you be kind and forthcoming about all of the abilities. Your shapechanging is fine, very seethrough, but fine. Could you tell me the abilities in the camp have before we go there? “Well. stealing faces. Zhuo-do steals part of your identity too? It takes a piece of your soul or smth. Its disorientating having your face stolen, but when its done by her- its additionally disorientating. She has a knife. Also a twisted piece of wood is the symbol.” Whats the meaning of the butterfly “They come out of the wall sometimes? She says theyre an important creature….” You dont know what meaning is, do you “Theyre red and theyre butterflies, they come from paradise, maybe theyre messengers, speak to her.”\nTheres a bloodthirsty guy but not as powerful as zhuo-do <br>Leave, go grab <a data-href=\"Kazuma Oono\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kazuma-oono.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kazuma Oono</a> “What brings you my door so late!

Recently something has changed since- at the start of the summer, the grave was cracked open, reanimating the monks, though im privy to history i cannot leave, only listen at the walls, that is what ive gathered. If you have any questions about what happened before my death, im happy to answer.” G: Tell a bit more about me? I read the letter you sent my mother. I know something happened, but i cant remember everything. Confusing “It might be best that way.” G: Thats what my mother said too. I dont understand. “Its pretty straightforward. Just live a normal life. And then, in your next life, start thinking back on the horrors. You dont have to risk it and keep spiraling. You can stop here.” G: im already far beyond a normal life, i’d say. “So? You assume youre in karmic debt from the nature of your creation, i dont think its accurate.” G: what do you think? “I think you can life a normal, happy life in the confines in the cycle of reincarnation.” G: i plan to have a happy l;ife, id like to understand the past. I already ran into someone who knew me “Ill help you to free the town, but after you should leave, you’ll keep running into them. They’ll keep making you worse.” G: how will they make me worse? “You can pause on your path to enlightenment for one life instead of sinking lower.” Z: we paused for a hundred lives “Its still the same one!”\n“Wait. how do you know that?” Z: hints\n<br>G: explains the situation abt <a data-href=\"Xin Yue\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/xin-yue.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Xin Yue</a> “Oh yikes. Her other half is gonna be mad about that. I cant actually purify the shrine myself. But if you did and returned it to its spot in the garden, you can talk to the founder of the monastery who is stuck in the tree. By restoring the shrines you can speak to her briefly. She’s going to be mad you were give too many hints. I suppose. Not that shes trying to keep you in the dark. It seems an awfully difficult thing to come to grips with.” G: we just want to help the monastery “For sure.” Z: we’ve died a hundred times, nothing has changed, why not try something new? “I’ll give you my notes… i just dont think we need to get into guiying’s rap sheet.”\n“Have you noticed that we’re all dead? Have you thought who could be responsible? Its her. Shes an awful bitch. Think in your heart if you want her to make you worse.” K: has this happened multiple times? “YES.” G: how can i make amends for a life i cant remember? “BY BECOMING A FARMER. I will. Tell you somethings. I would like you to purify the statue.” Z: you’re old. Presumably. “Yes.” Z: the people have town have forgotten. What gods have been forgotten? “The fiend.” Z: but the fiend isnt the one that did this im sure. If he did, his presence would be in town, wouldnt ahev to send envoys. “Damn it. If i wasnt stuck in this room. I think, and again this is before we were resurrected, whoever fucked around with the tree and let the fiend rise as a god, the 3 who were in the tree at the time would remember, i think my lingering ghost heard a ritual occurring but…”\n<br>“Theres a door that leads to a garden, that leads to stairs, down which leads to the base of the tree.

Ive atoned for each day. More than a handful will know the shame. Do you have any questions about the monastery? You can also rest here.” Z: do you have an armory? “Noo storage room. There was a nice shield hung up on the walls near the shrine recreating the tree?” G: if we’re able to purify the shrine, will you be able to move to your next life? “Once the danger is gone, ill be able to move on.” G: you deserve a good life. A happy one. “Ill take a rain check, and when you recall yourself, you can say it again if you believe it.” G: um. Uh. do you know where zhi hui is? “Well. aforementioned shrines. She’s found within the tree. But restoring the shrines will give her the power to manifest again. The entire monastery is her domain?”\n“Theres one right here, youd have to bring it back to the garden. Theres a recreation of the tree, a statue of jian’soo, and a statue of a deer. Itd probably take 10 mins of prayer to purify the statues?” Uhhh so the statues head “Reattaching should be fine? Then purify?” Go through the garden “Hello there!”\nOh god wtf is that A fiend of glutteny. A nindoru, fiends that are separate from reincarnation. Can manifest objects from thoughts “Welcome to my dormitory!”\n“Are you in search of a shrine? A statue?” Yes “The deer?” Its one we’d bargain for “My stomach is empty, ive been filling it with the stone, id be willing to regurgitate it for you. Maybe a pound or two of your flesh? Just an arm.”\n“Im quite enjoying having this artifact in my stomach, but i miss human flesh more. I dont want to fight if you’re willing to trade. Just a hand or foot.” Theres a beast out there? “Its not living!”\nOk combat\nOk we get the deer statue\nPut it back to the pedestal 10 mins Zhi hui “Excellent, thank you, i… appear before you… very weakened…. Thank you, its been so long since ive been able to see beyond the tree. I can remain long enough to answer 1 question of me, there are other statues.” Z: what happened to the tree? Who are the other people? <br>“Trapped with me are <a data-href=\"Tan Sui-Jin\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/tan-sui-jin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sui-Jin</a>, <a data-href=\"Xin Yue\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/xin-yue.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Xin Yue</a>, the fiend kugapte.

His attempt, it backfired, and cracked open the grave, plunging us all into a mindscape. I… cannot see how many years we’vve repeated the cycle, but i know something has changed outside.

That is an interesting question. I hate to it, but we dont fully know. I can tell you how the first- what he is? What type of demon, and how the first one was formed, but the specifics of him and an xui jin’s rivalry are unknown. If that would give you something to work with. Yes pls Hes a type of fiend called a nindoru, they form the corruption of the cycle of reincarnation. When a mortal is taken from the cycle of reincarnation and corrupted, it becomes a nindoru. Break cycles, hide their true faces, they look and act undead though they are alive. Each is a type of cycle from a natural world or social tradition and most importantly, they eat the souls of those who have reincarnated multiple times. But they don’t take the whole soul. They take pieces of you away, especially those who are about to ascent to true enlightenment, they shred the soul and send you back to the sea of enlightenment, but you are no longer complete. They’re the greatest threat, most abhorrent, its possible when your soul is shredded, you could be so incomplete that you reincarnate into one of these creatures. <br>Before the war that ate the gods, when ascending/losing deific status was easy, these fiends amassed and lost followers quite swiftly. The first nindoru fiend, it is said, was a human child born to samsaran parents. They felt it would be best for the child to live among humans to recall and learn and go thru the process as one should, but as he learned of his true heritage, instead of feeling grateful to be raised among humans he felt rejected, upset. They hoped that he would live harmoniously and reincarnate back into a samsaran in his next life, but he became angry and resentful. His name was <a data-href=\"Sigek\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/sigek.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sigek</a>. <br>Became bitter against all those that were reincarnated, demanded to know why life was only achievable thru and arbitrary karmic cycle, became obsessed with achieving perfection beyond the cycle of life and death, worked for a lich, the lich tells him about a soul cage that helps him achieve this. He couldnt accept vulnerability so he turned on his master and kept him in the soul cage. He travelled and spoke to others of likemind, around the time of the slaughter in the heavens in which <a data-href=\"Lord Jiyong\" href=\"misc/gods/seasons-of-ghosts-gods/lord-jiyong.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lord Jiyong</a> was executed at the behest of judge <a data-href=\"Lady Yaojun\" href=\"misc/gods/seasons-of-ghosts-gods/lady-yaojun.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lady Yaojun</a> and so became obsessed with undeath and reincarnation. After many years his sizeable congregation perhaps with the backing of lord jiong, he created a ritual written in his records that would shatter the wheel and free us all from the cycle of life and death. After that no one saw him or his cult, they went in to perform the ritual and didnt emerge. Later that year, the 1st of nindoru fiends appeared, and around this time the most powerful of them appeared, sigek and kugapte. Its unknown their relationship, is sigek took his name or took his soul. They claimed the ritual was a gateway that always existed. Its possible in the age of gods that the cycle really did get broken <br>(oh god cliffnotes from <a data-href=\"Elizeth Candora\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/elizeth-candora.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Elizeth Candora</a>. Part of this is taken from pathfinder lore, touchstones. 3 judges, theres a Court of Silence, known to many a scholar, during the war in which the gods were eaten, they realized this creature, something before the gods was lost to time, bc they were very involved, they were messing shit around, throwing divine energy out at an irresponsible level. Someone, angry, created a creature that fed off this energy. The more they got involved, the bigger it got, until it could eat planets. They had to call in the non-divine extraplanars to get assistance (no devils, demons, angels, axiomites, etc) like the elementals perhaps. Whole thing, they fought, theological importance. They got pretty far. To slow him down, in the middle of the godeater war, the gods (100s to thousands) retreated back to the outer planes. They formed a council of deities that could minorly influence the mortal realm. The 30 on A’s pinterest are the ones that known to exist, at least said they were here. Kind of a. Symbol of death = someone has complete influence over that domain. Some deities have a domain, some have multiple. Dragon lady head of the pantheon, golden, had a husband. Husband had a twin brother, the night killed the moon to get the sun, she ordered the execution of the night (jiyong) they came back from the dead, they represent reincarnation. Jiyong represents undeath)\nOk not a major god, most likely a local god or someone who had a taste of divinity\nWhat could be helping him get this sort of power? Well. there are a number of ways that he could be helped, but the first is that he is in combat with tan zui jin and he’s asleep (unlikely). To my understanding, the things youve seen outside of the monastery comes from unconscious recollections We did see his butterflies Hm. but did you see anything such as the tree in this yard. People we cant remember He certainly has an influence over the entirety of this area. We have encountered those worshipping him <br>There is likely, on the otherside of this trapped base, he has a very powerful quajin. Xin yue, they create rituals to bolster him. At some point, a man with spiritual ownership of the town conducted a ritual- (the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" data-href=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/heh-shan-bao.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Governor</a>) it seems as tho in doing this and putting the down on the line, thought he was going to exorcise the demon and get more influence, may have put the town spiritually in the ownership of this demon, which is a very powerful thing for a demon to have. There is also in some ways, your own spirits unintentionally feeding the continuation of this terrible nightmare Wdym? Because weve been thru so many cycles? Yes and the moment it continues, your governor sought to bolster the tree and instead cracked the grave of the fiend. He grows in strength, various people have come here to stop him. He had less influence at the start Does he just keep doing this cycle? Yes, xin yue has been cycling and chanting and without his followers sensing his presence have returned to bolster him. If only there was a way to revoke ownership from the governor <br>We need to go outside to the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sze\" data-href=\"Sze\" href=\"places/iactaleia/sze.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">capital</a> and get one of us to become the governor If you can find some way to make yourself interact with the outside world, that would certainly help things considerably.

I’ll think about killing myself but I want to kill one of you first Why do you think working for the demon that your lover killed would bring her back? “My lover didnt, my lover died in that fight. Guiying and i sucked ass and ate shit.” You fuck up once and make it better “Are you doing that?” Yeah “Can you do that? You undead freak?” Youre one to talk “Which is why i want my real body back.” So what do you monks do.

Does she even feel any regrets? (Mostly a probe to see if she still has emotions or if Kugapte is suppressing them. Less for her more for us to have a signal to look out for.) <br>I think perhaps establishing this monastery was a mistake, I thought we might work together to strengthen the <a data-href=\"Tan Sugi Tree\" href=\"places/iactaleia/willowshore/willowshore-hinterlands/tan-sugi-monastery/tan-sugi-tree.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sugi Tree</a> and protect <a data-href=\"Tan Sui-Jin\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/tan-sui-jin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sui-Jin</a>’s legacy. I should have known our enemy of one thousand years might have plans equally long in the making. Is this even his mindscape or are we in something greater's mindscape? This monastery is not his mindscape, he has slumbered in his own dreams beneath this tree for much longer than we. <br>How does Kugapte have a perfect memory of <a data-href=\"Willowshore\" href=\"places/iactaleia/willowshore/willowshore.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Willowshore</a> if it is his mindscape. He does not, you do. If this is to be one of the anchors of the plain, why is it allowed to change? It shows signs of decay and change far more than the 4 months we've been in the loop, let alone you remembering the cycles. The mindscape reflects metaphor and memory, in this case it also reflects the condition of the monastery as it has become since my passing. Did we die when entering into the dreamscape what of our bodies in reality? We must hold hope you were transported here completely. Have you been able to cultivate power across cycles or does that reset whenever the reset happens?

How he died? What he did? I know, but to tell you would be to deprive you of your spiritual journey. I could summarize a tome, but it would not be the same as reading it. Will want to know about what to expect from this fight. They’ll have to fight her lover and kugapte, anything to look out for? The fiend may offer you boons to turn to its side, pray do not listen. Only the enlightened and saint has truly resisted his corruption, a priestess almost enlightened with one spark of doubt could not. What does she want from this fight. This is her lover after all and he can respect that she presumably still cares for her. Is there a way to cleanse xin yue’s soul and help her? Is that what zhi hui would want? <br>A fiend in hell might one day reach enlightenment, but she who believes herself outside the cycle must first meet <a data-href=\"Lady Jansoo\" href=\"misc/gods/seasons-of-ghosts-gods/lady-jansoo.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lady Jansoo</a>’s judgement. <br>thoughts on the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" data-href=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/heh-shan-bao.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Governor</a> and what he did that caused this to happen (insert probing about how the mayor was totally stupid, he couldntve done all this himself, etc,) (trying to get more information out of her on what the mayor did to have all this be the outcome of that snowball) I passed on far before the governors arrival in this town, you will have to find him, or whatever is left, and ask.

Found a solution for the fog wall?” Kav: Not yet, we have leads related to the governor, if you know anything about him? “He asked me questions about local spirits in the past 2 years.

He did pay an old lady, she died in the night during the seasons of ghost festival. Now it's just a little child there. He was asking about bolstering seals.

Looking out into the streets, all appears normal and I have confidence that my vast imperial training came in handy. It seems I have figured out a solution the monks did not. With all luck this should keep the jorogumo from being interested in this land.\nEveryone seems in good spirits today, there is even talk of a small statue of myself to be built. I'm surprised they recognize my brilliance but certainly I shall not turn down some much needed recognition.\nPerhaps I should write to mother and father, surely this would make them proud. Although, I don't trust mother not to gossip with the other minor ladies of the court. That would prove problematic.\nI've stowed away my notes, thankfully I should no longer need them. It is best to set aside all of this and go enjoy a cup of tea for once.\n<br>Something strange is certainly afoot. I ran into a certain <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Kazuma Oono\" data-href=\"Kazuma Oono\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kazuma-oono.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">playwrite</a> today. He spoke to me in a way he hasn't in a long time. He invited me into his abode but of course I decline to take advantage of this strange charm. Perhaps my notes will include some manner of indication as to why his personality might suddenly change. Was the fiend the cause of our arguments all along? Surely he cannot reach all the way to the city of ghosts.\nIt seems not, there is something deeply wrong with the city. Something is clearly wrong with the ritual.\nIts taken weeks but I know what went wrong now. Those damnable spiders sabotaged the ritual.\nHow could this have happened, I confirmed that princesses plans with her handmaiden. I hope she still lives, that beautiful (if naive) woman.\nClearly, they had some reason not to want the fiend released. They must fear him. Perhaps he has a grudge against them?\nDamn it all, none of the villagers know anything I don't already know. The monk, alchemist, and cleric were completely useless.\nThe spiders are closing in, I saw her today, that princess, standing in front of my manor surrounded by five shades.\nMy protective wards must be keeper her off me, but if she can pass into the realm of the dead, then she is beyond my immeasurable power.\nI'll need to find some assistance to keep her off of me. I'm almost finishing the ritual that can save us all, but if she gets her hands on it we shall all be doomed. “Yeah i am this is my manager”\n“There was a great debate. I was sent here to ensure your souls make it to the afterlife. The most efficient way to do that was to kill you all 100 years ago. Im not allowed to save you directly/\nKavi: so you acted as a merchant?\nBird: “YEAH YOU ACTED AS A MERCHANT, A LITTLE HELPFUL, HUH?”\n“As was human custom, i didnt aid directly. I was an impartial observer.”\n“Succeeding in your ritual will join you in the sea of souls eventually. After your natural life span. Which is basically the same as if i killed you 100 years ago.”\nZ: why do i have souls attached to me?\n“Well. isnt that the question? Im trying to answer impartially in a manner that isnt tooooo helpful.”\nBird reguritates a notepad and a quill. “IM A PSYCHOPOMP JACKASS” “Dont take 100 years im tired of being here.” “A great number of people died in this town when you were young. You are a kind person. The dead do not know always when they are imposing. They see… one of themselves receive help and they want help as well. And now there’s- they can only speak to you with the exception of the monk and the whisperer when you are closest to their domain. Which um. I imagine might be off putting.”\nZ: do kind people burn others alive?\n“Did you burn some people alvie???”\nZ: they mightve not been alive\n“No, they werent. Those were manifestations of the fiend. To look like you.”\n“I might think it be appropriate to help these souls to speak to the one theyve bound themselves to.”\nBird: “GIMME ANOTHER POUND OF BIRD SEED AND I WONT PUT IT IN MY NOTES.”\n“If there is a particular spirit you want to understand, i can help you speak. If you would like to sever your connection to the spirits, i could reap them all. Idk what itd do to you.”\n“Id wait to decide if you get out of here or not.”\n“Well. if you need- if i can aid- well impartially observe, in a freely open info way now that we’re on the same page, let me know and i will see what i can do.”\n“I sincerely hope you go to live long lives even if it adds some time to my own trials.”\n“The souls already eaten by the fiend, youll have to defeat him to try to get them back. You could save everyone here once, then they are alive for real. Again, this is probably the last cycle. The exorcists are- causing lots of trouble.”\nKavi: no pressure i guess\n“Im being a realist, its better you know that this is your last chance.”\nZ: what happened at the end of the others?\n<br>“You either dont find out at all and go to bed the night before, wake up. This one- they have destroyed the guardian of your town in the real world. They smashed the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Ugly Cute\" data-href=\"Ugly Cute\" href=\"misc/ugly-cute.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">spider</a>.

I suspect its the case. I will impartially observe and its unlikely theyre a force that could stop me from observing impartially. Are there any questions about the real world you’d like me to observe? Youll need to prepare to live in the current time.”\nKav: what is the current time?\n“Its been 115 cycles.”\nG: giving current laws and empires-\n“I dont know the price of sushi. Speaking of.”\n“Its the spiders.”\nKav: the jorogumo. Makes sense\n<br>“<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Ren Mei Li\" data-href=\"Ren Mei Li\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/ren-mei-li.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Shes</a> a nightmare to deal with. Sorry for being scarce. It causes troubles when the visitor makes her appearance.”\nZ: was that one real? Or fake?\n“It is- she’s not in here. But. she is a powerful occultist that visited within the first year and tried to get in here. You are… owned by her.”\nKav: was that someone imitating her?\n“Idk the difference between her and someone who would look like her. That was a jorogumo.”\nG: the person who came here wasnt super powerful at occultism.\n“Do not forget, the other contender is an ancient fiend. To break through boundaries, typically one is not so accustomed as yourselves.”\n“Well. i have gifts for you soon if not already. Ive been- when you dont see me i go off to collect items of power to give to you.” A half elven woman with brown hair is hanged in the center of town.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/seasons-of-ghosts/session-18.html","sessions/seasons-of-ghosts/session-20.html","places/iactaleia/willowshore/downtown-willowshore/governor's-manor.html","npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/heh-shan-bao.html","misc/groups/jorogumo.html","npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/xin-yue.html","places/iactaleia/willowshore/downtown-willowshore/downtown-willowshore.html","places/iactaleia/willowshore/willowshore.html","npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/asahina-shinzo.html","places/iactaleia/willowshore/willowshore-hinterlands/tan-sugi-monastery/tan-sugi-tree.html","npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kazuma-oono.html","misc/ugly-cute.html","places/iactaleia/willowshore/willowshore-hinterlands/tan-sugi-monastery/tan-sugi-monastery.html","npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/ren-mei-li.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/seasons-of-ghosts/session-19.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761449867318,"modifiedTime":1764435888358,"sourceSize":11284,"sourcePath":"Sessions/Seasons

would your character be doing if they were not in wizard experiment hell? Same as he's always done: getting by by selling junk and useless trinkets to those who don't know any better. Why won’t they go back to doing that as soon as they escape? He's actually started to understand the junk he's collected can work well in a pinch. Sure, he could go back to selling junk, but why would he do that when he can actually get away with collecting stuff that actually works? Maybe he could actually find the break he's been looking for. Where are they from? <br>Here and there. It's hard to get an answer from him about it sometimes, but those who really push could probably figure he's from some little settlement at the southernmost coast of <a data-href=\"Welterglow\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/welterglow/welterglow.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Welterglow</a>. Probably. Who were they to the community they were from? Local conman pedaling mostly fake \"magic items\" with a penchant for getting into trouble he really shouldn't be getting into. Mostly known for being able to sweet talk his way out of the worst of it. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? <br>His apprentice, <a data-href=\"Cecylia\" href=\"npcs/former-pcs/cecylia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cecylia</a>. She's a young elven tiefling woman, around 19 y/o, with. He picked her up up not too long ago when she tried to scam him. They've become quite close, and he sees her quite a bit like family. She was out on a trip to a town in central <a data-href=\"Barrenbreak\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/barrenbreak/barrenbreak.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Barrenbreak</a> when he got taken; for all he knows, she thinks he's dead or has decided to leave her.\n<br>A distant cousin from <a data-href=\"Ravenyard\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenyard.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ravenyard</a>, <a data-href=\"Ryker Maddox\" href=\"npcs/wizard-experiments-npcs/ryker-maddox.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ryker Maddox</a>, who he's met and touched base with a couple of times. He's a good man, mostly, running a small company of bodyguards for hire. He's likely still there, if he hasn't taken up his next job. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Beyond being captured and being experimented on by the wizards? The first time he got caught for selling someone a faulty piece of junk. He was only fourteen, voice cracks and all, and people trusted him. Heavily, in fact! He had that sort of trustworthy face. But he'll never forget the way that customer's face was distorted in rage as they chased him through the streets. He still chuckles thinking about it. Why do the wizards think they can get away with experimenting on your character? He's already such a willing test subject for the weird and the strange, though he didn't exactly expect his pedaling of totally legit \"experimental\" items would get him locked up in some wizards' test dungeon. Oops, that's his bad. How long have you been captured by them? Not long; probably six months at the best, a year at the worst. Time really blends together in there. What kind of experiments have they been conducting on you? Mutagens, magical items, and experimental talismans, mostly. The kind where you really don't want to be on the receiving end of; he's faced a good chunk magical backlash, but that's just allowed him to take the time to copy it all to memory and turn them back against those who captured him. How is this reflected by your class/background/mechanical choices? Thaumaturge collect the strange and turn it to their advantage. At level 2, I'll be taking the Talisman Esoterica feat to start being able to make talismans he remembers from the testing and using them to his advantage. What’s your characters goal beyond simply escaping? Expanding his occult knowledge to better understand why these things work the way they do. Additionally, he really wants to figure out what the end goal of all this experimentation is; he knows he's not the only one being experimented on, and frankly, he has some choice words and perhaps a punch to throw to whoever thought this all up. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? I'm going back to my sleezey secrets era &gt;:3 but really i wanted to create a character who could theoretically be idolized later in stories, but those who know him know he's kind of a shitty guy. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? i wanted to try something new! perhaps try a mix of mostly ranged martial with the ability to support + i wanted to mess around with familiars! From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? theoretically, he could have been a rogue, but his fascination with the occult was far greater than his wish to \"legally take and sell\" things. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Deception being the highest for him... tracks the most with his conman tendencies. Thievery being his 2nd highest shows that he's not particularly the most trustworthy around potentially valuable items. How does your character view themself? How do others view your character? Reliable. A friend to those in need. A bit overly excessive at times, but who isn't? :)\nFull of himself. Sleezy. A nice guy at the best of times, a selfish asshole at the worst. Does still try his best when it comes down to it, but gods, must it really be when it comes down to it? Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? Theft and dishonesty are a natural part of life. If either happen to you, you shouldn't be upset about it. The weak should be left alone; if you're picking on those who don't deserve it, you're worse than they'll ever be. Make him feel bad; not emotionally, he's been called far too many names to count. Torture or, at the very least, threaten bodily harm when he can't get away and you've got your man.

class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Journey</a>SPOILERS\nPersonally Questions What would your character be doing if they were not on this adventure? Probably searching the coast for the suitable thing or information to prove that she's \"all grown up\" now. She's been mapping the weather, sketching down animals and plants she sees, in the hopes that she finds that \"just right\" proof that she's worthy of being a druid. Why did they choose to take this boat? It’s not the first ship going out, it’s the first one headed south. It is not clear if there’s land in this direction. It's a learning experience, and it didn't want to miss out on what could be nature that adapted to a land different than it's home. She wants to prove to her old druid summoner that she's capable of using this life given to her for good, and if not, she'll be another addition to the nature of this new land. This boat was chosen specifically because she'd been in the area and it has some connections to her swashbuckling friends. Where are they from? <br>She was created from a small, flowering lotus pond not too far off the coast of <a data-href=\"Amberreach\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Amberreach</a>. She came into her own person, and not a familiar, after traveling with her druid summoner for a long while. She found she quite enjoyed the life on the sea, surrounded by the Swashbuckler Society. Who were they to the community they were from? The little chipper flower leshy that was a bit too nosey for what it's able to do. It's eager to learn, but it's more interested in the sea around the boat than the actual boat itself. What has been the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Falling overboard after goofing around too much. As scary as diving into the water was, she found that floating on the waves, surrounded by a new aspect of nature she had yet to experience was comforting. She almost tried to dive back in when they fished her out! What’s your characters goal? Learning as much as it can about the world the crew is sailing into, tracking as much of this and gaining life experience as it can until it's certain that the people that watched it come into it's own would be proud of who it's become. <br>What is your characters relationship with the <a data-href=\"Swashbuckler Society\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Swashbuckler Society</a> and the <a data-href=\"Maronda Shipping Company\" href=\"misc/groups/maronda-shipping-company.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maronda Shipping Company</a>? It essentially \"grew up\" on one of the Swashbuckler Society's ships. Sunny's basically known sea-life longer than living on land. From a narrative perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? Narratively, she's following in the footsteps of her original summoner. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Medicine, Nature, and Survival all show that she is conscious of the environment around her and willing to protect it. It's happy to patch up her friends and those who have shown they're good to be around. Describe your characters personal edicts and anathemas. Come up with a situation where they would to go against these beliefs. Edicts: Record Natural Phenomena: Observe and keep a record of natural phenomena, animal behavior, plant growth patterns, and weather changes.\nOffer comfort in words - healing is more than physical.\nExperience the physical world.\nTake the Long Road: Take a long-term perspective in all aspects of life. Anathemas: Pollute the air, allow those who cause major air pollution or climate shifts to go unpunished.\nDespoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the Wildsong to non-druids.\nDisturb Sacred Silence: Disrupt the natural silence of sacred groves or natural sanctuaries. For her to go against these beliefs, she would have to literally come to terms that she's going to go against some of the things that were drilled into her as she learnt how to be a druid. Player Questions What do you want to get out of playing this character narratively? I'm hoping to have a sweet &amp; goofy little guy who ends up growing into someone who can be relied upon to help when you need it most. What do you want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? Ideally assist my buddies with healing, the occasional support spell, and some whammy elemental damage. Campaign Questions What do you hope to see in this campaign? chances to utilize my speak w plants, i miss cipher puzzles a lot even if we do them outside of game, if theres anything abt the actually active gods id be quite interested but thats not super necessary What would you prefer not to have included in the campaign? specifically river boat combat.... i did not enjoy that much on sunday, otherwise we're p good ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Ancestry/Leshy","#Class/Witch"],"headers":[],"links":["misc/windseeker.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html","pcs/sunny-skies/journey.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html",".html","misc/groups/maronda-shipping-company.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pcs/sunny-skies/sunny-skies.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724461579185,"modifiedTime":1761872409833,"sourceSize":4975,"sourcePath":"PCs/Sunny Skies/Sunny Skies.md","exportPath":"pcs/sunny-skies/sunny-skies.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":306,"backlinks":["homepage.html","pcs/sunny-skies/journey.html","sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas.html"],"type":"markdown"},"pcs/brightfang.html":{"title":"Brightfang","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Windseeker\" href=\"misc/windseeker.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Windseeker</a>, <a data-href=\"Avasoryd\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Avasoryd</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Class/Thaumaturge"],"headers":[],"links":["misc/windseeker.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pcs/brightfang.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761869943540,"modifiedTime":1762100233109,"sourceSize":101,"sourcePath":"PCs/Brightfang.md","exportPath":"pcs/brightfang.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":308,"backlinks":["homepage.html","sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas.html"],"type":"markdown"},"pcs/curlathrion.html":{"title":"Curlathrion","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Avasoryd\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Avasoryd</a>","aliases":["Curly"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Class/Investigator"],"headers":[],"links":["places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pcs/curlathrion.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761870325293,"modifiedTime":1762100220808,"sourceSize":129,"sourcePath":"PCs/Curlathrion.md","exportPath":"pcs/curlathrion.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":309,"backlinks":["homepage.html","sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas.html","sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-11.html"],"type":"markdown"},"pcs/hulang.html":{"title":"HuLang","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Windseeker\" href=\"misc/windseeker.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Windseeker</a>, <a data-href=\"Avasoryd\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Avasoryd</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Class/Bard"],"headers":[],"links":["misc/windseeker.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pcs/hulang.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761870060362,"modifiedTime":1761870309368,"sourceSize":95,"sourcePath":"PCs/HuLang.md","exportPath":"pcs/hulang.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":311,"backlinks":["homepage.html","sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html":{"title":"Amberreach","icon":"","description":"This country was formed within the last few decades.It was previously part of <a data-href=\"Fallencall\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fallencall</a> and ruled by a Wizard Lord who experimented on his population.

The island used to be a part of <a data-href=\"Netherrim\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/netherrim/netherrim.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Netherrim</a>, but was cursed just the incident that led to the Netherrim wastes. Only a select few families being able to live upon it. It is unclear how the city provides itself with food and water, considering most crops are subject to the curse as well. Oddly enough, sometimes visitors are allowed on the island but there reports are must different than those of errant curse resistant family members. People presumed dead or missing have lived there many years, thought to be completely gone, only to suddenly return on a ship escorted by Nereids.Oddly enough, creatures of the opossum family are plentiful on the island. There are five main families that have freedom to enter and exit Bluewall.<br>The first is the <a data-href=\"Kanok Family\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kanok Family</a>. Long ago, they escaped the desolate lair of a Spirit Naga and fled to the island. Almost all members of the family have deep purple scales.<br>The <a data-href=\"Kai Family\" href=\"misc/groups/kai-family.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kai Family</a> is a family of humans whose ancestors once lived in the <a data-href=\"Plane of Air\" href=\"places/planes/elemental-planes/plane-of-air.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Plane of Air</a> serving a great and evil air elemental. His great evil cursed them, causing them to emit sot-like smoke. They aren’t welcome in many other countries and found Bluewall the only place they could live comfortably. Any Sylphs, regardless of ancestry, who manifest this strange miasma are happily adopted into the family. Children born of this family who do not find themselves covered in cloying fog are quickly sent off the island. <br>The <a data-href=\"Olaf Family\" href=\"misc/groups/olaf-family.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Olaf Family</a> is descended from a clan of <a data-href=\"Azoicmound\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/azoicmound/azoicmound.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Azoicmound</a> alchemists and brewers. Their ancient founder was accused of plotting against the core tenants of the country and her entire family was to be sent to death. They escaped and fled to the island, willing to risk its curse only to find they were not affected by it.<br>Lastly, there are the water dwelling <a data-href=\"Maelstrom Family\" href=\"misc/groups/maelstrom-family.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maelstrom Family</a>. Originally from <a data-href=\"Levinea\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/levinea/levinea.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Levinea</a> , their ancestor fell in love with one of the Nereids who lived near the cursed island. The original ancestor could not bear the curse and got sick often. But the Nereid crafted them a heart shaped amulet that protected them from both the Nereids touch and the curse of the island. When their children were born, they were innately able to withstand the islands‘ curse. <br><a data-href=\"Polris\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/bluewall/polris.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Polris</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Families of Bluewall","level":2,"id":"Families_of_Bluewall_0"}],"links":["places/iactaleia/avasoryd/netherrim/netherrim.html",".html","misc/groups/kai-family.html","places/planes/elemental-planes/plane-of-air.html","misc/groups/olaf-family.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/azoicmound/azoicmound.html","misc/groups/maelstrom-family.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/levinea/levinea.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/bluewall/polris.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/bluewall/bluewall.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724461582937,"modifiedTime":1764382668214,"sourceSize":2732,"sourcePath":"Places/Iactaleia/Avasoryd/Bluewall/Bluewall.md","exportPath":"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/bluewall/bluewall.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":330,"backlinks":["misc/groups/kai-family.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/bluewall/polris.html":{"title":"Polris","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/bluewall/polris.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761159181391,"modifiedTime":1761159181391,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Places/Iactaleia/Avasoryd/Bluewall/Polris.md","exportPath":"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/bluewall/polris.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":331,"backlinks":["places/iactaleia/avasoryd/bluewall/bluewall.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/crystalwaters/crystalwaters.html":{"title":"Crystalwaters","icon":"","description":"Crystalwater is entirely surrounded by mountains and the country <a data-href=\"Tawdrywilde\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/tawdrywilde.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tawdrywilde</a>.

They preferred wizards specifically, because of their versatility. They were not treated fairly in most courts, more as commoner tools to achieve a means to an end. They were encouraged not only to serve their noble lords without question, but to fight and die for them.Around the year 200AC, several noble lords brought their mages with them to a clandestine meeting in the east of the country. At this fateful meeting, the mages were left to their own devices while the Lords drank and made merry, the tradition of wizards being anything less than loyal servants long forgotten, it struck these individuals that the mages they’d been fighting on behalf of their lord were actually the same as they were. Not evil, but pressed into service.These individuals stayed in contact, building networks of court mages. Then, one fateful day, almost all of the court mages in the country revolted. They cut the county clean in two with ease. Claiming the area known as Fallencall for themselves.The attitude of elevating mages from the common people bled into the very foundations of Fallencall. With their newfound independence, the wizards chose to rule above the common people. They separated the country loosely, giving territory to each powerful mage who participated. The mages had no higher authority to answer to, nor any duty to the villages the country happened to swallow up. This lawlessness granted them the freedom to live as they pleased, but also lead to chaos and confusion for those without aptitude for magic.Almost immediately, the wizards descended into infighting. Using powerful magic to exact their rules on other mages and fighting against other mages. Use of the Wish spell particularly was prevalent in this period. The fighting ravaged the country, changing its very geography and leaving it quite unusual and broken up. When it was down to a handful of the most reasonable or strong wizards, they met together and decided upon a set of accords. If one wizard were to violate the rules, they would face retribution from all the other ruling wizards. This included banning of the wish spell for uses beyond the recreation of other spells.Aside from following the provisions, each wizard was free to rule his land and his people as he saw fit. Wizard Lords often raise apprentices out from the common folk, while being careful not to teach them too much. Eventually, one of their apprentices becomes as strong and more clever than they are, and they’re replaced. The new Wizard Lord is then free to reshape his domain as he sees fit.Most Wizard Lords keep their populace healthy and educated, understanding it is in their best interest. Some do not care, using people for cheap labor and discard them, preventing them from escaping through arcane means. These Wizard Lords are usually disposed up when eventually their tyranny combined with the magic that seeps into the very soil of the country to produce a powerful champion of the people. <br><a

Many of the events of this war are likely more metaphorical than factual. For example, their Iron War Titans were likely Giants wearing plate mail.At the end of the war, the entire region was desolated, the fertile soils and teaming corral reefs completely wiped from the map. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including soil erosion and other natural phenomena. It seems equally unlikely that a war could truly have this destructive power.Those that survived the war formed a number of separate clans or tribes in order to survive in the wasteland.

Scholars hotly debate this fact as he did not appear in public nor remove his mask for a great deal of that time. During his rule, he slowly parceled off sections of his land to his children, allowing them to take their mother's name and append his surname - Jūn (君), meaning ruler.Each direct child of his formed their own noble house, with the intention that the eldest of descendants would serve on a ruling council. There were over 30 recognized noble families at the time of the Raven King's abdication. The ensuing wars and infighting significantly weakened the country. Over the last millennia, this number has steeply declined. The mage revolt of the 200s also caused a high number of families to lose their lives, titles, or territories.In the current day, there are approximately a dozen noble families in good standing. They oversee the country with minimal public infighting. They follow a feudal system, leasing land to the peasantry. The quality of life of the average common person is dependent on the current lord's benevolence, although most of the wiser lords remain wary that their power is dependent on their people not rising up in anger.

How do you know?” It’s written all over your face. “The old man hasn’t been gossiping again?” Again? “The old man who loves to yap hasn’t been whispering in your ears?” Not particularly. “Huh. Sure.” We helped fight some sort of gorgon and then intimidated the drake you killed to leave us alone so they offered us refuge. “Well, that’s certainly more than what I was expecting of your group.” Yes. They said they would take care of us as one of their own. “Wow. So you’ve become one with the peasants.” And you’ve lost status with them. “Yes, I HAVE gained citizenship among the nobility. I LIVE there, I’m a son of the rightful lord.” And they treat you as one of them? “YES.” But you’re only the 4th in line? “There is no direct and clear ranking of lineage, I am only saying I must be NINTH, because there are 8 people participating ahead of me. There might be 7 actually. So actually 8th if I WERE participating. So who will say if any of those 8 are alive by the new year.” Winks “NOT ASSASSINATION. I just mean if anyone DIES here-” Ok. THE PRINCE SAYS MURDER WILL HAPPEN- “Get your retainers under control lest something HAPPEN to them, princess!”\n“It is a serious crime to unlawfully obtain information about the tournament before it begins.” (He seems to have an earnest conviction about this, about the fairness of the tournament and that it’s a crime.) “Obviously I am a practitioner of the arcane. I wouldn’t be able to inherit the throne if not.” What spells do you know? “I have… a wide knowledge of spells… but I prefer those which the element of my family. (fire) I can technically cast others but it isn’t- I should say, I am exceptional at casting the spells of my family legacy.” Such as…? “Fireball.” And? “............Many others.” pulls out spell book and leaf through it (thinner than a wizard’s spellbook, but legitimate spellbook)\n(Lists off several fire spells off the arcane list that are 4th level or lower) So you said it’s unlawful to obtain info abt the tournament beforehand right? “Yes.” Has anyone been punished for it before? Who? “Various peons who sneak into monasteries.” No one higher up? “Not in the last 20 years? Most- Anyone wise enough to lead a group of people is not stupid enough to mess with divine authority.” Not stupid enough to mess with it by their own hand. “Well. I mean. The lord of flame- I haven’t seen anyone smited recently. And the lord of flame would inform the monastery if it happened. That’s how gods work.” And if they knew and didn’t care? “If he knew someone was interfering with his sacred ritual and didn’t care?” I’m just saying, religious orgs aren’t immune to corruption. “Maybe where you’re from that’s the case. But here is different. My father has spoken highly of them considering they’re mortal and druids and such. Not arcane (the best).”\n“Perhaps investigating the city would be good.”\n“When do you plan to enter the city. Will you wait for your peasants to go in, or will you go in before them? Or after them?” Why do you want to know? “Out of curiosity for your plans and movements.”\n“I can assure you that none of the foreign nations will provide better comfort in the desert environment than… though they are peasants, and obviously you wounldn’t be welcome with the Xitlati group. So obviously best to not go with another group. It sounds like a waste of your princesslessly time.” Well I might as well check. “Sure.” Would you like to escort me to the Xitlati group? “Is that a request I can deny, or is that…. An order from a soon to be ruler of a nation.” You can say no but if they ask, I would say I met you but you didn’t walk me over. “I would be willing to offer a small exchange of info… If I were to know you were of kind heart and a good person, then I might… What would you want for you to stay with the Nelsi clan until they stay in the city?” What is the reason? “Obviously they mean nothing to me on a personal level. They have only 1 warrior and you all. If you leave them, they may face retaliation from those that know how poorly defended their camp is.” Who would try to retaliate against them? “Well. Plenty know that they are not trained warriors and since you all obviously were the ones to defeat the basilisk and the cave bats and intimidate the drake (gritting teeth), it would be…. A boon to a group of…. Peaceful, culturally important people if they were to be protected by those outside their tradition of nonviolence.” In exchange for a small favor of course. 2, really. “May I know the favor before I agree?” Of course. But if you know, then we’re conspirators. And if I die or go on death row, I’m ratting you out immediately “Speaking of conspirators, if you would not mention me asking of you…” Of course. Someone of the city is violating divine right, if you could investigate with whatever networks you have to find out who’s doing it, that’s favor one. “That’s a heavy accusation. As a favor to you, I will take it into my heart and pursue it.” If we are attacked and you happen to see, could you find it in your heart to be someone else and fight? “Of course.” (gives him a masquerade scarf)\n(trade scarves)\n“I will give you 1 piece of advice. It would be best to introduce yourselves as unaffiliated with me.”\nIt would be best to not know each other, simply discussing varying cultures as 2 royals. Go over to metal group Conjured metal bubbles atop the sand\n3 people walking around\nA section open to the air, showing a number of weapons that contain runes, scalemail\n<br>Stuff is marked up 20x what we would by back in <a data-href=\"Avasoryd\" href=\"places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Avasoryd</a>\nA fellow in clothes, jewlry, metal accessories, a metal sword at his hip, a belt buckle\nOther 2 are moving around in the back\nHe approaches us <br>“Welcome to our humble sword shop. My name is <a data-href=\"Exigo\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Exigo</a> of Ferreus. I’m here on behalf of our great nation selling our goods. For a good price. You won’t be able to get them outside of <a data-href=\"Ferreus\" href=\"places/iactaleia/the-shattered-seas/ferreus/ferreus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ferreus</a>. You seem like discerning people who want to pick up more weapons for the upcoming tournament.” Why would I need more weapons? I only have 2 hands “I heard that one year they only did axes.”\n“We’re the official sellers to the Xitlati group.”\n“Our metal is better than the local obsidian weapons of the local group.”\n<br><a data-href=\"Mutata\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mutata</a>, a cleric, is robed in a dark color, covering the entire body. A slight glow coming from where the eyes should be\nThis fine man wanted me to swing a weapon at you “You wanted to test the quality of the blade? Of course. Are there any you had in mind? I’m happy to explain the enchantments our enchanter put upon them. I see you’re familiar with metalworking, but I don’t recognize the style from anywhere in Ferreus.” (Guy stands there for a second, lights go out, and then turns around to find item to find a very, very nice glaive) Stupid expensive\nI’m sorry, I don’t have your currency, I only have gold. You know gold? “Of course. A rare metal. Where are you from that a metal is easily acquired?”\n“I cannot speak on behalf of all, I am too far away to do so, but I can imagine that would be of great interest if you have any contacts that might be interested in trading or anything of the sort with our nation.” We’re acting as legal ambassadors for the premiere trade company of our home “How wonderful. I will offer you the rate we offer for nobles of this land, which is significantly less than those not involved with agreements of ours as a show of faith. Let me calculate what the equivalent to this particular weapon would be in gold weight and then I shall make trade. I am happy to offer suitable weapons to any of you all. It would be my honor.” (Hear a slight whirring noise.) “We have no elemental lord, or governing body in a sense. We make decisions in a collective manner.” Did you have one before? <br>“We still do in a sense. He stepped down many years ago after the populace requested he do so. Now he helps with trade. Mr Exigo works directly with Mr <a data-href=\"Vergo Quaestus\" href=\"npcs/elemental-exploration-npcs/vergo-quaestus.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Vergo Quaestus</a>.” You’ve been selling directly to the Xitlati group? “Yes. We have a direct connection with Mr Quiestus. Their base of operations give access to materials not found in Ferreus. We do not have volcanic activity, at least not natural volcanic activity. So their access to places we could not enter is very helpful.”\n“The Xitlati group purchased many of our items this year. It’s a great year for us.” What did they end up getting? “Many swords, staves, knives, bows. Many enchanted by our enchanter, the runes etched directly into the metal of the weapons so on the downside they cannot be removed like a runetag, but they are very well made and sturdy.” What did they get enchanted? “The fundamental runes as well as several elemental damage runes that weren’t all fire, which I found interesting. Cold and electricity were very popular this year.” Oh! That’s interesting. “Perhaps it’s hotter this year and having arune to cool you down may help. Our enchanter did a really good job on the electricity runes!” They must know they’re so popular because they’re prestigious. “Yes, I suppose! There doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason behind their business.”\n“I will say that as good customers, I wanted to let you know there is some dangerous contraband (metallic inventions) that have been found. We think the dealer will be here attempting to pass them off as quality items. If you see any, please let me know so that I may ensure that this is put a stop to and no one gets injured and that the reputation of our craftsmen stays good and they get the recognition they deserve.” Of course! “Excellent. Many thanks.”\nHow long will you be here after the tournament?\nWe will head to the Xitlati compound and then heading home. We will enter the city to ensure that we don’t miss the culprit from our bridge stakeout. We also have many sales to make here, and the sons of Atlak have more of their compatriots… followers is not the right word. Friends! I guess. Of the brothers who might be making some purchases.” Oh! Are they on way? “I think so! The party next door seems to get rowdier every as they imbibe before their ritual combat.” ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-18.html","sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-20.html","places/iactaleia/the-shattered-seas/tlahuiaekatl/kalikali/kalikali.html",".html","npcs/elemental-exploration-npcs/elder-nelsi.html","misc/groups/sons-of-atlak.html",".html","npcs/elemental-exploration-npcs/granite.html","npcs/elemental-exploration-npcs/teicneltiqui-xitlati.html","misc/groups/nelsi-clan.html","npcs/elemental-exploration-npcs/tehalani.html","places/iactaleia/avasoryd/avasoryd.html",".html","places/iactaleia/the-shattered-seas/ferreus/ferreus.html",".html","npcs/elemental-exploration-npcs/vergo-quaestus.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-19.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761869711557,"modifiedTime":1762104539252,"sourceSize":14898,"sourcePath":"Sessions/Sailors of the Shattered Seas/Session 19.md","exportPath":"sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-19.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":573,"backlinks":["sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas.html","sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-18.html","sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-20.html"],"type":"markdown"},"sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-20.html":{"title":"Session 20","icon":"","description":"Prev: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sessions/Sailors of the Shattered Seas/Session 19\" data-href=\"Sessions/Sailors of the Shattered Seas/Session 19\" href=\"sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-19.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Session 19</a><br>\nNext: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sessions/Sailors of the Shattered Seas/Session 21\" data-href=\"Sessions/Sailors of the Shattered Seas/Session 21\" href=\"sessions/sailors-of-the-shattered-seas/session-21.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Session 21</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Kalikali\" href=\"places/iactaleia/the-shattered-seas/tlahuiaekatl/kalikali/kalikali.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kalikali</a>\nSomething has been written on our chalkboard <br>“Urgent message from desk of Director <a data-href=\"D'Volta Aomar\" href=\"npcs/former-pcs/d'volta-aomar/d'volta-aomar.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">D'Volta Aomar</a>.

We’ll take care of it later.”\n(All filled with hatred toward others than against each other. Don’t all look related, united by another common cause/circumstance than blood.) Dol’Ore - What exactly is your training schedule to be perfect? Despite the bragging, he’s probably a better spellcaster than the magus. They’re probably better than us, but they have a lot of guys Dol’Ore - how does allying work if only one wins? If we were to fight and we were allied, would I just throw? “Many fight. If you were to ally us, we could ensure you have comrades to fight alongside no matter what they decide for the teamwork to be this particular year. If we were to fight against each other, we still want to know who’st he best among the family.

It’s more meditative, so whenever I need to think about a problem or get apprehensive I keep doing this!” What were you thinking about? “My partner hasn’t arrived yet! It’s sad to fight with a single half!” Who’s your partner? <br>“<a data-href=\"Ter Cibar\" href=\"npcs/elemental-exploration-npcs/ter-cibar.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ter Cibar</a>! Escorting people back here that haven’t arrived yet, and despite doing the right thing, I’m worried.” (He’s a textbook description of a Jibali.)\nIs your partner also a stone geni? “No! He’s a mortal man.” Is he from the Nelsi clan? <br>“No! <a data-href=\"Sthira\" href=\"places/iactaleia/the-shattered-seas/sthira/sthira.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sthira</a>! We are not welcome to return, so we travel!” Why? “I gave up my immortality!” Ok cool! “I still have the appearance and many abilities of my elemental nature!” Why’d you do so? “1. For love. 2. What is the reason to live forever holding your age if you experience nothing? It’s better to live to the fullest and die!” Noble! “Separating myself from- I could not travel with my person if I were still tied entirely to the earth so I became, through accident, mostly, something else. My eternal father is upset! But he can’t get me here, so.” Who’s your father? <br>“The so called rightful lord of S’thira, <a data-href=\"Catajunga\" href=\"npcs/elemental-exploration-npcs/catajunga.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Catajunga</a>. He spent 500 years hewing me from stone to be the perfect son to follow to enforce his perfect order. Unfortunately, it did not work. He was not skilled enough to make a perfect being.”\n“He considers himself to be perfected, so who knows how many people’s souls were crushed to make me.” They just shoved souls into the stone to make you? “My understanding! Upon learning that a lot was sacrificed to make a perfect backup in case the armies of change came knocking upon his door, I was so abhored that I banished the specifics from my mind so that no others may do the same.” Oh! How’d you do that? “Magic! I allowed those resisting my father to look into my mind and take any memories they wish from it and learn all they can so that they could find a way into his eternal vault.” They have ur memories now? “They know the contents, and promised that they erased things lost to time, such as how to make a stone son without connection to the plane of earth.” (If what he says is true that this area is not properly connected to the plane of elements to shape a new child/procreate with another similarly powerful djin.. There’s all sorts of way to make people, maybe there are ways to make new elementals? Though without the obvious forms, it would have to be something drastic.) “I think its similar in a way to creatures of undeath. I do not know, I have done my best to return fragments of souls so that they may rest and that I may die with the one I love. The grievous damage of the act can never be undone. So now I must put as much joy into the world as I can and fight for the things that make it better. See if I can honor the sacrifice of the.”\n“To make new life means to take of the finite resources upon this plane.” Are you participating or just waiting? “I do! Hopefully my partner will use his connections to tell us who we will be fighting for this year. It would be deeply irresponsible to rule this nation.” Do you want to fight with us? And we can duke it out once we win. If your partner doesn’t arrive, of course. “Only if I know who you’re entering the tournament.” Lost continent. “That’s really cool, I’d love to visit there and meet the warriors” We could bring you. Don’t feel pressured. “Much appreciated, I will pray for his safe return in time and I shall see if any of those I have fought with as comrades I shall consult for whom we raise our fist.” Are only stone elemental lords made that way, or all elemental lords? “I must assume that they are all reliant on squeezing mortal souls for energy. For power. Flesh. I’m not sure the key component, I would think the soul. I don’t know how the other lords make their children, I suspect this lord was not passed the secrets down.” SO if he were to die, the cycle ends here for fire? “Why else do you think he’s so desperate?” How tragic. “The crown gives him a great deal of power. The church follows the crown here.” There are some old loyalties, right? Someone else has the crown now, right? “He’s an incredible warrior. I am a strong warrior. I contain many strong warriors within me who I would like to honor by continuing to hone their skills. This mortal man has created- he has become a legendary warrior through his own actions and deeds. The people’s beliefs in him.” I don’t think you should be disqualified, it what you do with your life that matters. You’re also great. <br>“I have sparred once, several years ago. My partner and I stayed in to assist in a rescue in a cave system and I have the power to punch through stone. Afterwards, as part of our reward, <a data-href=\"King Towani\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">King Towani</a> beat us both with ease and without question.

I don’t think I’ve seen another year with slaughter in the years.

It didn’t start with child kidnapping.” What did it start with? “I mean, I was given- I was a farmer, but one summer maybe a year or so ago, all the water dried up and we could no longer really feed ourselves. Some of the lord’s men passed by and they told us they just happened to be in the area and told the ablebodied farmers that if they came to work with them, they’d ensure comfortable lives for our families, and I didn’t- at first, I didn’t think it was- I had doubts. But then my neighbors started signing up and their spouses and children would receive packages of food and water every week. The men would come visit home and be able to see them after a few weeks of being a guard. I watched for a while, watched my family get ill and starve and figured that this was the best way to make sure they had food.” What was up with the demon? Sorry.

One of a person in charge with power?” - D “Hes a Fucking Cockroach, the only thing he cares about is preserving his lineage and it keeps going and we are all under the thumb of the elemental lords for the rest of our fucking lives” - Teij “I have proof his lineage is fallable. I have the corpses of three of his sons” - D “Good work, nice.” - Teij “I did it while saving the nelsi clan” - D “Oh. That explains a lot.” It seems her opinion is changing. She will not say sorry. “So. His sons. Their corpses”\n“Rotting in the streets, proof that he doesn’t care about them or any of his future sons”\n“He will probably just disown them, to him the sons are disposable, dont even get me started on the daughters, but he wants an ELEMENTAL son, and hes convinced since he had a human mother, somehow that will work out, that there will be a kid who is an elemental, meanwhile he is letting these kids who were raised in his compound believe that they somehow have a chance of being the heir to the lordship.” - Teij\n@ Touani, Dolore: “Do you have any children?” “Uh no.”\n“Then why not allow those who wish to to fight for the honorable king. Take the children from him and raise them as your own.” - D “Woah, idk that i’d make a good father”\n“Its easier than being a king.”\n“It’s not hereditary, the actual throne”\n“Naturally, they’d have no reason to not defect from Atlak. It’s not like they’d have any more claim to the throne”\n“Idk about a raid on the compound or like starting an orphanage. Teij are there more adults out there?”\n“Yeah probably, unless you killed them all. Which ones did you kill?” - Teij “(Lists them off).” - D “Oh,, okay! I mean theyre assholes, there’s definitely at least another adult running around. It’s not that hard to open your eyes the second you are exposed to ideas that are outside what you know.”\n“We already have one that is slowly coming to us.”\n“Which one”\n“Cant say”\n“I mean yeah, I’d let anyone who wants to fight under my banner on my behalf join, anyone who wants to serve the will of the people and wants out from under the thumb of elementals is welcome to take the crown. NOT THAT I DONT WANT IT” - Touani “Well, if he wont come out for that, wont come out for his own children… His own children must know where he is?” - D “I know where he is.” - Teij “And you wont tell us?” - D “I just told you I know where he is, I negotiated a deal on getting in there. There is a back entrance, that is my next stop after making sure everything is as stable-” “He will run.” - D “True..” - tej “If you really want this to end and help the people, she needs to kill the king, you need to win the tournament.” - D “Iuhuhhh,,,, uhm,,, that doesn’t… you know, I’m just going to fight in the tournament and I am not going to know about anything else going on, so I’m going to go practice with my uh… my glaive, now. Have a great day.” - Touani Gonna go be willfully ignorant of whats going on <br>“I will say, there is a problem. If Touani happens to lose and Atlak takes the throne… I don’t know how rules are connected to the lands they are over… In your land, but…. Do you know of the Monastery in the mountains?

They have a sister city across the cut in the world. THey have some bridges, but they are heavily controlled.\nGiant blighted land in the bottom right where they took all the soil, nothing can grow there now. They drained all the resources. Some of the religious people consider it a holy site and have temples in there. Good place to hide. Little bit of land that exists, religious city in the bottom right. Has water. Big scrubbed canyon desert in the middle that is starting to be revitalized.\nSection covered in trees is very hostile to all things metal. They are fighting and pushing nature back, Quaestus’s competing companies in sister cities are in the isolated rocky mountains/grassland area. They don’t let just anyone live there. They are not draining the land quite as fast. They are the same as Quaestus, different hat.

Idk I can only really do terrorism because he will look at me and go oh that is an angry automaton back to haunt me, I better smite that thing\nI mean he can die the same way the other guy did. Maybe we will need to find someone closer to him to find exactly what weaknesses he has, but that would be in his corporation.\nYou could go right to the main city and kill him in his sleep, or you could go about it more in an intel way.\nG: Is there a metal forge competition, is there anything he comes out for his people for?\nHe does trade deals, he likes parties in his name, likes to show off his wealth.

Do you recognize this necklace?\n“Umm… vaguely? Its bridal jewelery from, what, a couple decades ago?”\nSh: at least i know this belonged to my parents. This was. Um. and it is- cursed??? Um. and. Um. do you remember a little bit ago when that woman was found hanged at silvermist?\n“What???”\nSh: yeah. Okay. theres a lot going on. Ok i dont want you to freak. So please don’t.\nKat: you might want to take a seat?\nSh: um. A few weeks ago one of the hunters was found hanged in one of the cabins.\n“Thats terrible.”\nSh: yeah. Um.\n“Is that were you grew up?”\nSh: thats where i lived with my parents. She… looked like me. Not identical, half elven, short brown hair, skin like mine.\n“We met once or twice. When she was your age she looked almost exactly like you.”\nSh: it happened again. Another woman in town was hanged. This time in public. Um.\n“Awful.”\nSh: we found the necklace there. The necklace- idk if you remember, that festival when we visited my parents i visited it with them\n“I thought you got it from your friend’s sister.”\nSh: it was there. Where she was hanged.\n“So we have a grave robber that’s killing young women? We should take it to the guard right away.”\nSh: i dont want anyone to panic. Thats the last thing we need.\n“If they die thats worse, you cant come back from dying!”\n“Im assuming its her wedding necklace- shizuka have you told your friends about your circumstances, itll open up the whole can of worms. I didnt even know we had a half sister until the governor needed someone to put shizuka with when she died.”\n<br>Sh: my <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shizuka's Mom\" data-href=\"Shizuka's Mom\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">mom</a> was an affair baby, i grew up there with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shizuka's Dad\" data-href=\"Shizuka's Dad\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">them</a>.

I like to think we’re doing better than we were, it was tense at first.\n“It was a little bit of a surprise tbh.”\nSh: i dont blame you. But like. It was kinda a surprise for all parties involved. Im assuming this necklace came from my father to my mother.\n“Is there a chance that your father… cursed your mother?”\nSh: i dont think so?? They loved each other.\n“Who else did she have- a suitor? Scorned? Have you talked to anyone at the lodges that knew they were alive?”\nSh: not about this.\n“Again, i… passed her on the street, but i didnt know she was my sister before she was already dead. Anything that happened during her lifetime isnt smth i know much about.”\nSh: did grandma- idk what im saying. <br>Dr <a data-href=\"Damihansig Mababangloob\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/damihansig-mababangloob.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Damihansig Mababangloob</a> did the autopsy, they went hunting one day, were found ripped to shreds by some kind of large wild animal.

There wasnt anyone else that i- i guess- threatened their relationship?\n“I dont think so? We’ve had our fair share of arguments over the years, no one i know that tried to get between your parents.”\nSh: um. No one tried to get in the way. They had a healthy relationship, ik i saw it through tinted glasses\n“Yes they bonded. Bc of being abandoned by their parents, both of them.”\nSh: i feel like i remember that year\nKat: do we know anything abt their parents?\n“We do now! The amount of babies in baskets in this town is astronomical!”\nSh: yeah my dad was also abandoned\n“There was no one alive on your dads side, or you wouldve gone with them!”\nKavi: she was taken in by the governor, did he know her before that??\n“Someone mustve told him who you were related to, so they could place you with Yun Mong-un.”\n(discussing if shizuka’s aunt is her aunt fr)\n<br>Zhu: i know someone who’d know.

Silver shards. All can determine shes making bombs. Meant to hurt undead. Anti ghost bombs. “Ok what can i help you all with? Talk about your feelings?”\n“Im glad youre still alive and supporting my son?”\nZhu: of course. You did the abortion or delivery for one nadoya sanmi?\n“She had like 6 kids.”\nZhu: any still borns?\n“No.”\nSh: any memory of still borns in town?\n“Not me, im pretty good at what i do.”\nSh: i trust.\n“Not that im saying im the single decider of birth.

She delivered a healthy baby. More than 1. 2. Years apart due to the passage of time.”\nSh: but my mother was hers?\n“I delivered her. She had the cutest little ears. Idk why, your grandma seemed shocked by this.” Shes Very smart, but when it comes to understanding other people she is extremely unaware. A lot of technical knowledge Sh: yeah thats what we’re asking, sorry about being cagey\n“You were?”\nSh: idk what i was even being. Its been a long day\n“She was a healthy baby. I didnt hear much about her after she was born. I figured shed live on the other side of the river. With her new baby. They seemed like a really happy family. It was really nice that nadoya was also there after the birth. Your grandma’s husband was busy, so she went to support your grandma so she wasnt alone.”\nSh: did you report the birth? Keep record?\n“I keep my own notes? But. baby. Its kinda obvious. The government census, theyll just come to your house. Less work for me. I was ready to go meditate.”\nSh: there was a report made. Of my grandmother having had a stillborn.\n“Huh maybe she went to a different midwife? Or a clerical error? Its a pretty bad clerical error.”\nKavi: so like. You know abt guiying’s hopping situation?\n“He is influenced by a jiangshi, he was born to parents unrelated to them? It found him and changed him. And delivered him to the monastery,”\nKavi: have you told him?\n“No.”\nKavi: maybe you should tell him\n“He doesnt seem interested. He just keeps asking about his past lives. The monks were pretty clear i be pretty careful what i say lest he turn evil.”\n“I mean. I guess. We never saw them again. The jiangshi. If they dropped the baby off then they didnt want him, so why would they come back. I think if believes in the monastic spirit and meditates, he can overcome this. The monks says not to ask about the past lives, but this is the current one. So im sure its different. Thanks for being his friend! Feel free to take some elixirs while you go.
