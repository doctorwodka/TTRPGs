the necromancer Caius was attacked in his home, resulting in the building nearly burning completely to the ground. <br>Reports of seeing him (lost and confused, often mistaken for <a data-href=\"Caius Thaine\" href=\"npcs/chosen-by-gods-npcs/caius-thaine.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Caius Thaine</a>) went as far as northern <a data-href=\"Barrenbreak\" href=\"places/avasoryd/barrenbreak/barrenbreak.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Barrenbreak</a>. Put up a Huge Fight when the Church went to capture him, but he begrudgingly settled down when he found out they weren't attacking him. Public religious beliefs: \"The Church's beliefs are like, fine, I guess?\" says local man who slogged through several old ass books repeating the same story over and over again. He's knowledgable enough about the story that he can discuss with others who fully believe in what the Church believes at length. Private beliefs: The gods may represent different aspects of the world, but they clearly don't intervene where they should. He's still not 100% certain that the gods even actually exist and his Nex Umbra mark isn't just an elaborate setup by some sort of wizard. Time since capture: Roughly 2 years Important family and friends: <br><a data-href=\"Caius Thaine\" href=\"npcs/chosen-by-gods-npcs/caius-thaine.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Caius Thaine</a> - A necromancer who shares almost the exact same features as Sinani, almost as if they were reflections of each other. 5'11\"\nBlonde hair that falls just below his shoulders\nSeveral moles across his face\nPale grey eyes\nLooks like he hasn't seen the sun in weeks Dreams and aspirations: Stopping the rise of necromancy (as someone who has seen a necromancer in action) Expand his (modern) knowledge of the world Stop being put in Caius' shadow/fix the problems he caused Find out what Solace's connection to Nex Umbra is and why he was chosen How old are you:\n- Physically, like, 25.\n- Actual is like 2.5\nFinally get a chance to rest and really delve into what his new meaning for existence is. He wants to understand why Solace came to him with the mark from Nex Umbra. He wants to learn more about the world, more than what would be found in largely outdated books. What would your character be doing if they were not on this adventure? Likely trying to rally the people from under Caius to deal with him/his lackies. Probably wouldn't go very well due to the Sharing The Same Face situation, but, hey, most people haven't seen Caius face to face before! Why aren't they doing that now? It's better with friends and not endangering the general population :) Where are they from? Fallencall Who were they to the community they were from? <br>Caius's body double, somebody not needed until the Worst Possible Outcome happened to the <a data-href=\"Blackfrost\" href=\"misc/groups/blackfrost.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Blackfrost</a>. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? <br>A young elven woman named <a data-href=\"Rima Dahast\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rima Dahast</a> was the first person who helped him in the Church. As a cleric of Aos Baia, she was quite kind in introducing him into the Church and answered any questions he had. He's not entirely sure what she's been up to, but presumably she's still with the Chuch. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Meeting Solace! :3\nEscaping Caius and seeing the Real World and how it's drastically different than what he was led to believe, only to be snatched back up by the Church.\nLearning about the Blackfrost plague and the people dying to it. What’s your characters goal? Stopping Caius and preventing the spread of the Blackfrost and finding out why he was chosen by Nex Umbra. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? I wanted to play a character who's able to settle into his own skin and create a name for himself rather than be in someone else's shadow. I really like the concept of the \"twin\" of such an evil guy is actively going against him despite unintentionally taking advantage of the fact that they share a face to do so. I also really want to learn more about what the mirror realm entails and why the FUCK they are sending these beasts to fight these reflections. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? Big big dammy from Solace, while still being able to cast spells. :3 I like the concept of kind of being the martial and the support caster all in one From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? Due to being \"born\" from a reflection, he wasn't able to defeat Solace and instead accepted this strange mirror beast as his summons. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Arcana due to essentially being a wizard's apprentice for a little while, and has since tried to absorb as much information on the magical arts to try and understand what the FUCK is going on in the world magically\nAthletics is from having to fucking BOOK IT whenever there had been the chance he was gonna get snatched up, and is now like. Okay. I guess I should actually try to not let them grab me like that again Intimidation is due to the fear the Blackfrost puts into people, which he's using by, yknow, sharing his face Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? The dead shouldn't be desecrated, especially if they're normal people caught in the crossfire of stronger adventurers. (Korkau has been REALLY pushing this for him. Very uncomfortable with their Dead Snatching.) Lying &amp; hiding the truth is okay, unless it actively puts others in immediate danger. Murder under self-defense is fine, but if you're just killing to kill you're not really... going to be on his good side. Magic is power. Those who have magic should be trying to help those who don't, and if you're not, you should have a good reason. His friends or innocents would have to have be being threatened for him to go against his morals. However, he's quicker to cave if his own life is directly on the chopping block. He still wants to live. He wants to learn and grow. Would Sin ever consider changing their face? Honestly? Yes. If given the chance, he's have his face changed permanently so he doesn't have to face the comparisons to Caius ever again. Who were they to the community when they traveled? The odd guy with a giant tiger who, despite it, shrunk away from strangers at first. Eventually, he did open up to those who probed a bit, and he was more than willing to help out when needed. Never stuck around long, though, and did seem to be looking over his shoulder at any possible moment as if he was worried he was being watched. Where did they travel before the church got them? As far south as the northernmost tip of the Lunahelm Raiders. Without a map or worldly experience, it's kind of hard to get anywhere, really. Which, in hindsight, is probably for the best since he probably wouldn't have been a good fit there. Tell me about your time as a wizards apprentice He was overseen as he was taught how to work on cadavers by various Blackfrost workers. Elbows deep in rotting carcasses, only to later see them mindlessly walking to the Blackfrosts' orders. He was terrible at the actual raising part of necromancy, which was definitely... not ideal, but not the worst; at least he had some magical ability. He couldn't imagine what they would have had him do if he didn't have Solace. What happened before you escaped? He tried to learn about the world as much as he could. Half of the information went right over his head, but when he wasn't being forced into doing anything, he was sneaking books, or speaking with Solace, or probing the Blackfrost lackies for information. How did you escape? He took full advantage of the attack to hide Solace and sneak away in the heat of the moment. Stolen cloak and knife, the dark of night, and wandering blindly until he found a passage that was probably supposed to be under guard and he was... out. It shocked him, too. He spent all night running away until he hid in some poor family's barn to sleep. He couldn't shake the feeling that they let him escape but... he's yet to find proof of tht. Did you get to know any members of the Blackfrost? Very few Blackfrost members actually treated him more than some soulless husk for Lord Caius. Some were mean when he asked questions. Some were nice. The very, very few actually pitied him into speaking with him like a human being. The closest he got to know was a halfling called Len. He's not sure if that was a nickname or his actual name, but Len treated him the most like a person. That doesn't mean he was treated well, but he was still treated like he had thoughts and opinions outside of Caius's own. Len was there because he was promised sanctuary from local law if he helped Lord Caius. Sinani managed to gleam that he did something quite bad but Len never let slip what exactly he did. What’s the worst thing sin would do to survive? <br>\nGive up Solace, part of his soul, even it hurt him in the end (and by god it would hurt both of them).

She's a runaway from a small farming community called <a data-href=\"Bredani\" href=\"places/avasoryd/fallencall/bredani.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bredani</a> in south east <a data-href=\"Fallencall\" href=\"places/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fallencall</a>. She was never a farmer, and she was never that good in the arcane magics, so her and her collection of trinkets and doodads were never... appreciated, she thought. Who were they to the community they were from? The little kid who'd rather dig through junk than help out. She's sweet, yeah, but you have to drag her out of the house and physically put her in the field to get her to do anything and even then she obviously hates doing it. She's basically just a child, and now she's run away. With Idris, she was just chatty little sidekick that followed him around and seemed to get on his nerves. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? Idris. He took her in and taught her what he knew for the tools of the trade after she tried to scam him on a piece of junk she found that she knew was worth nothing. He's... well. You know where.\nLilika Naas. She's a gnomish woman that Cyl met in her brief time in Welterglow, who had actually spent time in the Swashbuckler Society before taking a small break to be on land. She taught Cyl the bare beginnings of the bardic craft, which she took to like a fish in water. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? The first week of actually living on her own, she hadn't realized how hard it would be. She'd expected it to be hard, but not this hard. One night, she had set up camp, sat down, and just started crying. She missed home, she missed people so bad, and she was this close to packing things back up and heading there. But after she stopped sniffling, she shook her head and promised herself that she'd be okay. That she was going to make her own home somewhere, she'd make friends and her own family, and she'll be okay. What’s your characters goal? Helping those who have been affected by the wizards and protecting them from being hurt once again. Bringing Idris back. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? Learning that she has to actually 'grow up' and realize that she doesn't have to take every little thing on herself. That she can be strong, but she doesn't have to be if there are those willing to help. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? :woozy: Other people not dying. From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? She's no thaumaturge, but she does learn how to take advantage of her voice and knowledge as much as she can. She learnt fighting styles from Idris, and how to properly hold a knife, but she How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Learning from Idris, she's taken her charismatic personality and pushed it further. She's diplomatic, she's deceptive, and of course she can perform. Living on her own, she's been forced to learn how to subsist on the natural world. How does your character view themself? How do others view your character? She thinks she's... okay? She tries really hard! She's doing her best! But she's just... okay.\nChatty, pushy, but overall a nice kid. Needs to figure out what she wants to do in life; she has so many years ahead of her. Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? Edicts: Take the Long Road: Take a long-term perspective in all aspects of life. Uncover the hidden value of every trinket. Anathemas: Forsake Collaboration: Disdaining teamwork, refusing to learn from others, or acting solely for individual glory. Judge worth by surface shine. Rely on others to fight your battles Those she trusted abandon her, they refuse to help her in the resurrection of Idris, or they actively hurt her after she has helped them.

Same as he's always done: getting by by selling junk and useless trinkets to those who don't know any better. Why won’t they go back to doing that as soon as they escape? He's actually started to understand the junk he's collected can work well in a pinch. Sure, he could go back to selling junk, but why would he do that when he can actually get away with collecting stuff that actually works? Maybe he could actually find the break he's been looking for. Where are they from? Here and there. It's hard to get an answer from him about it sometimes, but those who really push could probably figure he's from some little settlement at the southernmost coast of <a data-href=\"Welterglow\" href=\"places/avasoryd/welterglow/welterglow.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Welterglow</a>. Probably. Who were they to the community they were from? Local conman pedaling mostly fake \"magic items\" with a penchant for getting into trouble he really shouldn't be getting into. Mostly known for being able to sweet talk his way out of the worst of it. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? <br>His apprentice, <a data-href=\"Cecylia\" href=\"npcs/former-pcs/cecylia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cecylia</a>. She's a young elven tiefling woman, around 19 y/o, with. He picked her up up not too long ago when she tried to scam him. They've become quite close, and he sees her quite a bit like family. She was out on a trip to a town in central <a data-href=\"Barrenbreak\" href=\"places/avasoryd/barrenbreak/barrenbreak.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Barrenbreak</a> when he got taken; for all he knows, she thinks he's dead or has decided to leave her.\n<br>A distant cousin from <a data-href=\"Ravenyard\" href=\"places/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenyard.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ravenyard</a>, <a data-href=\"Ryker Maddox\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ryker Maddox</a>, who he's met and touched base with a couple of times. He's a good man, mostly, running a small company of bodyguards for hire. He's likely still there, if he hasn't taken up his next job. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Beyond being captured and being experimented on by the wizards? The first time he got caught for selling someone a faulty piece of junk. He was only fourteen, voice cracks and all, and people trusted him. Heavily, in fact! He had that sort of trustworthy face. But he'll never forget the way that customer's face was distorted in rage as they chased him through the streets. He still chuckles thinking about it. Why do the wizards think they can get away with experimenting on your character? He's already such a willing test subject for the weird and the strange, though he didn't exactly expect his pedaling of totally legit \"experimental\" items would get him locked up in some wizards' test dungeon. Oops, that's his bad. How long have you been captured by them? Not long; probably six months at the best, a year at the worst. Time really blends together in there. What kind of experiments have they been conducting on you? Mutagens, magical items, and experimental talismans, mostly. The kind where you really don't want to be on the receiving end of; he's faced a good chunk magical backlash, but that's just allowed him to take the time to copy it all to memory and turn them back against those who captured him. How is this reflected by your class/background/mechanical choices? Thaumaturge collect the strange and turn it to their advantage. At level 2, I'll be taking the Talisman Esoterica feat to start being able to make talismans he remembers from the testing and using them to his advantage. What’s your characters goal beyond simply escaping? Expanding his occult knowledge to better understand why these things work the way they do. Additionally, he really wants to figure out what the end goal of all this experimentation is; he knows he's not the only one being experimented on, and frankly, he has some choice words and perhaps a punch to throw to whoever thought this all up. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? I'm going back to my sleezey secrets era &gt;:3 but really i wanted to create a character who could theoretically be idolized later in stories, but those who know him know he's kind of a shitty guy. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? i wanted to try something new! perhaps try a mix of mostly ranged martial with the ability to support + i wanted to mess around with familiars! From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? theoretically, he could have been a rogue, but his fascination with the occult was far greater than his wish to \"legally take and sell\" things. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Deception being the highest for him... tracks the most with his conman tendencies. Thievery being his 2nd highest shows that he's not particularly the most trustworthy around potentially valuable items. How does your character view themself? How do others view your character? Reliable. A friend to those in need. A bit overly excessive at times, but who isn't? :)\nFull of himself. Sleezy. A nice guy at the best of times, a selfish asshole at the worst. Does still try his best when it comes down to it, but gods, must it really be when it comes down to it? Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? Theft and dishonesty are a natural part of life. If either happen to you, you shouldn't be upset about it. The weak should be left alone; if you're picking on those who don't deserve it, you're worse than they'll ever be. Make him feel bad; not emotionally, he's been called far too many names to count. Torture or, at the very least, threaten bodily harm when he can't get away and you've got your man.

Skies","icon":"","description":"SPOILERS\nPersonally Questions What would your character be doing if they were not on this adventure? Probably searching the coast for the suitable thing or information to prove that she's \"all grown up\" now. She's been mapping the weather, sketching down animals and plants she sees, in the hopes that she finds that \"just right\" proof that she's worthy of being a druid. Why did they choose to take this boat? It’s not the first ship going out, it’s the first one headed south. It is not clear if there’s land in this direction. It's a learning experience, and it didn't want to miss out on what could be nature that adapted to a land different than it's home. She wants to prove to her old druid summoner that she's capable of using this life given to her for good, and if not, she'll be another addition to the nature of this new land. This boat was chosen specifically because she'd been in the area and it has some connections to her swashbuckling friends. Where are they from? She was created from a small, flowering lotus pond not too far off the coast of <a data-href=\"Amberreach\" href=\"places/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Amberreach</a>. She came into her own person, and not a familiar, after traveling with her druid summoner for a long while. She found she quite enjoyed the life on the sea, surrounded by the Swashbuckler Society. Who were they to the community they were from? The little chipper flower leshy that was a bit too nosey for what it's able to do. It's eager to learn, but it's more interested in the sea around the boat than the actual boat itself. What has been the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Falling overboard after goofing around too much. As scary as diving into the water was, she found that floating on the waves, surrounded by a new aspect of nature she had yet to experience was comforting. She almost tried to dive back in when they fished her out! What’s your characters goal? Learning as much as it can about the world the crew is sailing into, tracking as much of this and gaining life experience as it can until it's certain that the people that watched it come into it's own would be proud of who it's become. <br>What is your characters relationship with the <a data-href=\"Swashbuckler Society\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Swashbuckler Society</a> and the <a data-href=\"Maronda Shipping Company\" href=\"misc/groups/maronda-shipping-company.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maronda Shipping Company</a>? It essentially \"grew up\" on one of the Swashbuckler Society's ships. Sunny's basically known sea-life longer than living on land. From a narrative perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? Narratively, she's following in the footsteps of her original summoner. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Medicine, Nature, and Survival all show that she is conscious of the environment around her and willing to protect it. It's happy to patch up her friends and those who have shown they're good to be around. Describe your characters personal edicts and anathemas. Come up with a situation where they would to go against these beliefs. Edicts: Record Natural Phenomena: Observe and keep a record of natural phenomena, animal behavior, plant growth patterns, and weather changes.\nOffer comfort in words - healing is more than physical.\nExperience the physical world.\nTake the Long Road: Take a long-term perspective in all aspects of life. Anathemas: Pollute the air, allow those who cause major air pollution or climate shifts to go unpunished.\nDespoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the Wildsong to non-druids.\nDisturb Sacred Silence: Disrupt the natural silence of sacred groves or natural sanctuaries. For her to go against these beliefs, she would have to literally come to terms that she's going to go against some of the things that were drilled into her as she learnt how to be a druid. Player Questions What do you want to get out of playing this character narratively? I'm hoping to have a sweet &amp; goofy little guy who ends up growing into someone who can be relied upon to help when you need it most. What do you want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? Ideally assist my buddies with healing, the occasional support spell, and some whammy elemental damage. Campaign Questions What do you hope to see in this campaign? chances to utilize my speak w plants, i miss cipher puzzles a lot even if we do them outside of game, if theres anything abt the actually active gods id be quite interested but thats not super necessary What would you prefer not to have included in the campaign? specifically river boat combat.... i did not enjoy that much on sunday, otherwise we're p good ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Ancestry/Leshy","#Class/Witch"],"headers":[],"links":["places/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html",".html","misc/groups/maronda-shipping-company.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pcs/sunny-skies.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724461579185,"modifiedTime":1761154371103,"sourceSize":4913,"sourcePath":"PCs/Sunny Skies.md","exportPath":"pcs/sunny-skies.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":113,"backlinks":["homepage.html","sessions/elemental-exploration/elemental-exploration.html"],"type":"markdown"},"pcs/zhu.html":{"title":"Zhu","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Willowshore\" href=\"places/avasoryd/willowshore/willowshore.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Willowshore</a>\n<br>estranged brother of <a data-href=\"Yong Wu-Xui\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yong Wu-Xui</a>, owner of Eternal Blaze Fireworks,\n<br>longtime friend of <a data-href=\"Kazuma Oono\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kazuma Oono</a> of the local theater\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Ancestry/Kitsune","#Class/Animist"],"headers":[],"links":["places/avasoryd/willowshore/willowshore.html",".html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"pcs/zhu.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761151202323,"modifiedTime":1761151389217,"sourceSize":253,"sourcePath":"PCs/Zhu.md","exportPath":"pcs/zhu.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":114,"backlinks":["homepage.html","sessions/seasons-of-ghosts/seasons-of-ghosts.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html":{"title":"Amberreach","icon":"","description":"This country was formed within the last few decades.It was previously part of <a data-href=\"Fallencall\" href=\"places/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fallencall</a> and ruled by a Wizard Lord who experimented on his population.

The settlement on the island is surrounded, perhaps unsurprising, by a blue wall. It is debated among northern scholars if the wall is literal, magical, or even metaphorical.Only those with express permission are allowed entry to the city. Others are left outside the walls where the islands curse sickens them or driven away by the Nereid protectors of the area. The island used to be a part of <a data-href=\"Netherrim\" href=\"places/avasoryd/netherrim/netherrim.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Netherrim</a>, but was cursed just the incident that led to the Netherrim wastes. Only a select few families being able to live upon it. It is unclear how the city provides itself with food and water, considering most crops are subject to the curse as well. Oddly enough, sometimes visitors are allowed on the island but there reports are must different than those of errant curse resistant family members. People presumed dead or missing have lived there many years, thought to be completely gone, only to suddenly return on a ship escorted by Nereids.Oddly enough, creatures of the opossum family are plentiful on the island. There are five main families that have freedom to enter and exit Bluewall.<br>The first is the <a data-href=\"Kanok Family\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kanok Family</a>. Long ago, they escaped the desolate lair of a Spirit Naga and fled to the island. Almost all members of the family have deep purple scales.<br>The <a data-href=\"Kai Family\" href=\"misc/groups/kai-family.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kai Family</a> is a family of humans whose ancestors once lived in the <a data-href=\"Plane of Air\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Plane of Air</a> serving a great and evil air elemental. His great evil cursed them, causing them to emit sot-like smoke. They aren’t welcome in many other countries and found Bluewall the only place they could live comfortably. Any Sylphs, regardless of ancestry, who manifest this strange miasma are happily adopted into the family. Children born of this family who do not find themselves covered in cloying fog are quickly sent off the island. <br>The <a data-href=\"Olaf Family\" href=\"misc/groups/olaf-family.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Olaf Family</a> is descended from a clan of <a data-href=\"Azoicmound\" href=\"places/avasoryd/azoicmound/azoicmound.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Azoicmound</a> alchemists and brewers. Their ancient founder was accused of plotting against the core tenants of the country and her entire family was to be sent to death. They escaped and fled to the island, willing to risk its curse only to find they were not affected by it.<br>Lastly, there are the water dwelling <a data-href=\"Maelstrom Family\" href=\"misc/groups/maelstrom-family.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maelstrom Family</a>. Originally from <a data-href=\"Levinea\" href=\"places/avasoryd/levinea/levinea.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Levinea</a> , their ancestor fell in love with one of the Nereids who lived near the cursed island.

They preferred wizards specifically, because of their versatility. They were not treated fairly in most courts, more as commoner tools to achieve a means to an end. They were encouraged not only to serve their noble lords without question, but to fight and die for them.Around the year 200AC, several noble lords brought their mages with them to a clandestine meeting in the east of the country. At this fateful meeting, the mages were left to their own devices while the Lords drank and made merry, the tradition of wizards being anything less than loyal servants long forgotten, it struck these individuals that the mages they’d been fighting on behalf of their lord were actually the same as they were. Not evil, but pressed into service.These individuals stayed in contact, building networks of court mages. Then, one fateful day, almost all of the court mages in the country revolted. They cut the county clean in two with ease. Claiming the area known as Fallencall for themselves.The attitude of elevating mages from the common people bled into the very foundations of Fallencall. With their newfound independence, the wizards chose to rule above the common people. They separated the country loosely, giving territory to each powerful mage who participated. The mages had no higher authority to answer to, nor any duty to the villages the country happened to swallow up. This lawlessness granted them the freedom to live as they pleased, but also lead to chaos and confusion for those without aptitude for magic.Almost immediately, the wizards descended into infighting. Using powerful magic to exact their rules on other mages and fighting against other mages. Use of the Wish spell particularly was prevalent in this period. The fighting ravaged the country, changing its very geography and leaving it quite unusual and broken up. When it was down to a handful of the most reasonable or strong wizards, they met together and decided upon a set of accords. If one wizard were to violate the rules, they would face retribution from all the other ruling wizards. This included banning of the wish spell for uses beyond the recreation of other spells.Aside from following the provisions, each wizard was free to rule his land and his people as he saw fit. Wizard Lords often raise apprentices out from the common folk, while being careful not to teach them too much. Eventually, one of their apprentices becomes as strong and more clever than they are, and they’re replaced. The new Wizard Lord is then free to reshape his domain as he sees fit.Most Wizard Lords keep their populace healthy and educated, understanding it is in their best interest. Some do not care, using people for cheap labor and discard them, preventing them from escaping through arcane means. These Wizard Lords are usually disposed up when eventually their tyranny combined with the magic that seeps into the very soil of the country to produce a powerful champion of the people. <br><a data-href=\"Blackspire\" href=\"places/avasoryd/fallencall/blackspire.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Blackspire</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Bredani\" href=\"places/avasoryd/fallencall/bredani.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bredani</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Frosthold\" href=\"places/avasoryd/fallencall/frosthold.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Frosthold</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["places/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenyard.html",".html","places/avasoryd/fallencall/blackspire.html","places/avasoryd/fallencall/bredani.html","places/avasoryd/fallencall/frosthold.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724461582971,"modifiedTime":1761152428516,"sourceSize":3344,"sourcePath":"Places/Avasoryd/Fallencall/Fallencall.md","exportPath":"places/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":137,"backlinks":["misc/pantheons/atheists.html","npcs/chosen-by-gods-npcs/caius-thaine.html","npcs/former-pcs/cecylia.html","npcs/former-pcs/sinani/sinani.html","places/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html","places/avasoryd/avasoryd.html","places/avasoryd/fallencall/blackspire.html","places/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenyard.html","sessions/chosen-by-gods/session-23.html","sessions/chosen-by-gods/session-31.html","sessions/chosen-by-gods/session-36.html","sessions/chosen-by-gods/session-50-epilogue.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/avasoryd/fallencall/frosthold.html":{"title":"Frosthold","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/avasoryd/fallencall/frosthold.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761152425858,"modifiedTime":1761152425858,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Places/Avasoryd/Fallencall/Frosthold.md","exportPath":"places/avasoryd/fallencall/frosthold.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":138,"backlinks":["places/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/avasoryd/gold-rocks/drakemere.html":{"title":"Drakemere","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/avasoryd/gold-rocks/drakemere.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761158776127,"modifiedTime":1761158776127,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Places/Avasoryd/Gold Rocks/Drakemere.md","exportPath":"places/avasoryd/gold-rocks/drakemere.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":140,"backlinks":["places/avasoryd/gold-rocks/gold-rocks.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/avasoryd/gold-rocks/gold-rocks.html":{"title":"Gold Rocks","icon":"","description":"This mountain country has been ruled by a line of Gold Dragons, <a data-href=\"The Aurum\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Aurum</a>, since anyone can recall.

Of course, no such proof of this exists in the current day. Apparently, winning the war required every Chosen of the time to join together against them. Many of the events of this war are likely more metaphorical than factual. For example, their Iron War Titans were likely Giants wearing plate mail.At the end of the war, the entire region was desolated, the fertile soils and teaming corral reefs completely wiped from the map. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including soil erosion and other natural phenomena. It seems equally unlikely that a war could truly have this destructive power.Those that survived the war formed a number of separate clans or tribes in order to survive in the wasteland. Due to its complete lack of resources and defensive positions, no pre-existing country claimed a stake in the land. This area was dubbed the Netherrim Waste around 0 BC. There has been silence from the region until the few decades.<br>A decade ago, an unknown but charismatic leader marched on <a data-href=\"Easterglen\" href=\"places/avasoryd/easterglen/easterglen.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Easterglen</a>, taking a massive chunk out of the southern farmlands.

Scholars hotly debate this fact as he did not appear in public nor remove his mask for a great deal of that time. During his rule, he slowly parceled off sections of his land to his children, allowing them to take their mother's name and append his surname - Jūn (君), meaning ruler.Each direct child of his formed their own noble house, with the intention that the eldest of descendants would serve on a ruling council. There were over 30 recognized noble families at the time of the Raven King's abdication. The ensuing wars and infighting significantly weakened the country. Over the last millennia, this number has steeply declined. The mage revolt of the 200s also caused a high number of families to lose their lives, titles, or territories.In the current day, there are approximately a dozen noble families in good standing. They oversee the country with minimal public infighting. They follow a feudal system, leasing land to the peasantry. The quality of life of the average common person is dependent on the current lord's benevolence, although most of the wiser lords remain wary that their power is dependent on their people not rising up in anger. Those who are born or marry into any of the -Jun families live in luxury. <br><a data-href=\"Ravenholm\" href=\"places/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenholm.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ravenholm</a>\n","aliases":["Kingdom of the Raven"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[".html","places/avasoryd/lunahelm-raiders/lunahelm-raiders.html","places/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html","places/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html","places/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenholm.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenyard.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1724461583066,"modifiedTime":1761158298864,"sourceSize":1791,"sourcePath":"Places/Avasoryd/Ravenyard/Ravenyard.md","exportPath":"places/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenyard.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":162,"backlinks":["npcs/former-pcs/idris-lanthorn.html","places/avasoryd/avasoryd.html","places/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html","places/avasoryd/the-grove-of-cycles/the-grove-of-cycles.html","sessions/chosen-by-gods/session-36.html","sessions/chosen-by-gods/session-9.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/arcanum.html":{"title":"Arcanum","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/arcanum.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761171144147,"modifiedTime":1761171144147,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Places/Avasoryd/Tawdrywilde/Arcanum.md","exportPath":"places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/arcanum.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":164,"backlinks":["places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/tawdrywilde.html","sessions/chosen-by-gods/session-36.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/lonake.html":{"title":"Lonake","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/lonake.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761150351426,"modifiedTime":1761150351426,"sourceSize":0,"sourcePath":"Places/Avasoryd/Tawdrywilde/Lonake.md","exportPath":"places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/lonake.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":165,"backlinks":["places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/tawdrywilde.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/avasoryd/tawdrywilde/tawdrywilde.html":{"title":"Tawdrywilde","icon":"","description":"Tawdrywild is a country full of magic and megafauna, located surrounding the mysterious <a data-href=\"Crystalwaters\" href=\"places/avasoryd/crystalwaters/crystalwaters.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Crystalwaters</a>. <br>For unknown reasons, the plants and animals are incredibly large and ferocious.
