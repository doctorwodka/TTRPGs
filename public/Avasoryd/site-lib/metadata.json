href=\"misc/groups/grove-druids.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Grove Druids</a>SPOILERS Notable history (that church knows): Was first seen in public after the necromancer Caius was attacked in his home, resulting in the building nearly burning completely to the ground. <br>Reports of seeing him (lost and confused, often mistaken for <a data-href=\"Caius Thaine\" href=\"npcs/chosen-by-gods-npcs/caius-thaine.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Caius Thaine</a>) went as far as northern <a data-href=\"Barrenbreak\" href=\"places/avasoryd/barrenbreak/barrenbreak.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Barrenbreak</a>. Put up a Huge Fight when the Church went to capture him, but he begrudgingly settled down when he found out they weren't attacking him. Public religious beliefs: \"The Church's beliefs are like, fine, I guess?\" says local man who slogged through several old ass books repeating the same story over and over again. He's knowledgable enough about the story that he can discuss with others who fully believe in what the Church believes at length. Private beliefs: The gods may represent different aspects of the world, but they clearly don't intervene where they should. He's still not 100% certain that the gods even actually exist and his Nex Umbra mark isn't just an elaborate setup by some sort of wizard. Time since capture: Roughly 2 years Important family and friends: <br><a data-href=\"Caius Thaine\" href=\"npcs/chosen-by-gods-npcs/caius-thaine.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Caius Thaine</a> - A necromancer who shares almost the exact same features as Sinani, almost as if they were reflections of each other. 5'11\"\nBlonde hair that falls just below his shoulders\nSeveral moles across his face\nPale grey eyes\nLooks like he hasn't seen the sun in weeks Dreams and aspirations: Stopping the rise of necromancy (as someone who has seen a necromancer in action) Expand his (modern) knowledge of the world Stop being put in Caius' shadow/fix the problems he caused Find out what Solace's connection to Nex Umbra is and why he was chosen How old are you:\n- Physically, like, 25.\n- Actual is like 2.5\nFinally get a chance to rest and really delve into what his new meaning for existence is. He wants to understand why Solace came to him with the mark from Nex Umbra. He wants to learn more about the world, more than what would be found in largely outdated books. What would your character be doing if they were not on this adventure? Likely trying to rally the people from under Caius to deal with him/his lackies. Probably wouldn't go very well due to the Sharing The Same Face situation, but, hey, most people haven't seen Caius face to face before! Why aren't they doing that now? It's better with friends and not endangering the general population :) Where are they from? Fallencall Who were they to the community they were from? <br>Caius's body double, somebody not needed until the Worst Possible Outcome happened to the <a data-href=\"Blackfrost\" href=\"misc/groups/blackfrost.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Blackfrost</a>. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? <br>A young elven woman named <a data-href=\"Rima Dahast\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rima Dahast</a> was the first person who helped him in the Church. As a cleric of Aos Baia, she was quite kind in introducing him into the Church and answered any questions he had. He's not entirely sure what she's been up to, but presumably she's still with the Chuch. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Meeting Solace! :3\nEscaping Caius and seeing the Real World and how it's drastically different than what he was led to believe, only to be snatched back up by the Church.\nLearning about the Blackfrost plague and the people dying to it. What’s your characters goal? Stopping Caius and preventing the spread of the Blackfrost and finding out why he was chosen by Nex Umbra. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? I wanted to play a character who's able to settle into his own skin and create a name for himself rather than be in someone else's shadow. I really like the concept of the \"twin\" of such an evil guy is actively going against him despite unintentionally taking advantage of the fact that they share a face to do so. I also really want to learn more about what the mirror realm entails and why the FUCK they are sending these beasts to fight these reflections. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? Big big dammy from Solace, while still being able to cast spells. :3 I like the concept of kind of being the martial and the support caster all in one From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? Due to being \"born\" from a reflection, he wasn't able to defeat Solace and instead accepted this strange mirror beast as his summons. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Arcana due to essentially being a wizard's apprentice for a little while, and has since tried to absorb as much information on the magical arts to try and understand what the FUCK is going on in the world magically\nAthletics is from having to fucking BOOK IT whenever there had been the chance he was gonna get snatched up, and is now like. Okay. I guess I should actually try to not let them grab me like that again Intimidation is due to the fear the Blackfrost puts into people, which he's using by, yknow, sharing his face Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? The dead shouldn't be desecrated, especially if they're normal people caught in the crossfire of stronger adventurers. (Korkau has been REALLY pushing this for him. Very uncomfortable with their Dead Snatching.) Lying &amp; hiding the truth is okay, unless it actively puts others in immediate danger. Murder under self-defense is fine, but if you're just killing to kill you're not really... going to be on his good side. Magic is power. Those who have magic should be trying to help those who don't, and if you're not, you should have a good reason. His friends or innocents would have to have be being threatened for him to go against his morals. However, he's quicker to cave if his own life is directly on the chopping block. He still wants to live. He wants to learn and grow. Would Sin ever consider changing their face? Honestly? Yes. If given the chance, he's have his face changed permanently so he doesn't have to face the comparisons to Caius ever again. Who were they to the community when they traveled? The odd guy with a giant tiger who, despite it, shrunk away from strangers at first. Eventually, he did open up to those who probed a bit, and he was more than willing to help out when needed. Never stuck around long, though, and did seem to be looking over his shoulder at any possible moment as if he was worried he was being watched. Where did they travel before the church got them? As far south as the northernmost tip of the Lunahelm Raiders. Without a map or worldly experience, it's kind of hard to get anywhere, really. Which, in hindsight, is probably for the best since he probably wouldn't have been a good fit there. Tell me about your time as a wizards apprentice He was overseen as he was taught how to work on cadavers by various Blackfrost workers. Elbows deep in rotting carcasses, only to later see them mindlessly walking to the Blackfrosts' orders. He was terrible at the actual raising part of necromancy, which was definitely... not ideal, but not the worst; at least he had some magical ability. He couldn't imagine what they would have had him do if he didn't have Solace. What happened before you escaped? He tried to learn about the world as much as he could. Half of the information went right over his head, but when he wasn't being forced into doing anything, he was sneaking books, or speaking with Solace, or probing the Blackfrost lackies for information. How did you escape? He took full advantage of the attack to hide Solace and sneak away in the heat of the moment. Stolen cloak and knife, the dark of night, and wandering blindly until he found a passage that was probably supposed to be under guard and he was... out. It shocked him, too. He spent all night running away until he hid in some poor family's barn to sleep. He couldn't shake the feeling that they let him escape but... he's yet to find proof of tht. Did you get to know any members of the Blackfrost? Very few Blackfrost members actually treated him more than some soulless husk for Lord Caius. Some were mean when he asked questions. Some were nice. The very, very few actually pitied him into speaking with him like a human being. The closest he got to know was a halfling called Len. He's not sure if that was a nickname or his actual name, but Len treated him the most like a person. That doesn't mean he was treated well, but he was still treated like he had thoughts and opinions outside of Caius's own. Len was there because he was promised sanctuary from local law if he helped Lord Caius. Sinani managed to gleam that he did something quite bad but Len never let slip what exactly he did. What’s the worst thing sin would do to survive? <br>\nGive up Solace, part of his soul, even it hurt him in the end (and by god it would hurt both of them). Go back to the <a data-href=\"Blackfrost\" href=\"misc/groups/blackfrost.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Blackfrost</a>, if things went truly to hell. Would sin get rid of sol if given the chance? Probably not unless he had very good reason to. Sinani's gotten pretty attached to Solace, even despite the \"magically attached to his soul\" part.

alt=\"cecylia.png\" src=\"attachments/cecylia.png\" target=\"_self\">SPOILERS Where are they from? <br>She's a runaway from a small farming community called <a data-href=\"Bredani\" href=\"places/avasoryd/fallencall/bredani.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bredani</a> in south east <a data-href=\"Fallencall\" href=\"places/avasoryd/fallencall/fallencall.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fallencall</a>. She was never a farmer, and she was never that good in the arcane magics, so her and her collection of trinkets and doodads were never... appreciated, she thought. Who were they to the community they were from? The little kid who'd rather dig through junk than help out. She's sweet, yeah, but you have to drag her out of the house and physically put her in the field to get her to do anything and even then she obviously hates doing it. She's basically just a child, and now she's run away. With Idris, she was just chatty little sidekick that followed him around and seemed to get on his nerves. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? <br><a data-href=\"Idris Lanthorn\" href=\"npcs/former-pcs/idris-lanthorn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Idris Lanthorn</a>. He took her in and taught her what he knew for the tools of the trade after she tried to scam him on a piece of junk she found that she knew was worth nothing. He's... well. You know where.\n<br><a data-href=\"Lilika Naas\" href=\"npcs/lilika-naas.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lilika Naas</a>. She's a gnomish woman that Cyl met in her brief time in <a data-href=\"Welterglow\" href=\"places/avasoryd/welterglow/welterglow.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Welterglow</a>, who had actually spent time in the Swashbuckler Society before taking a small break to be on land. She taught Cyl the bare beginnings of the bardic craft, which she took to like a fish in water. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? The first week of actually living on her own, she hadn't realized how hard it would be. She'd expected it to be hard, but not this hard. One night, she had set up camp, sat down, and just started crying. She missed home, she missed people so bad, and she was this close to packing things back up and heading there. But after she stopped sniffling, she shook her head and promised herself that she'd be okay. That she was going to make her own home somewhere, she'd make friends and her own family, and she'll be okay. What’s your characters goal? Helping those who have been affected by the wizards and protecting them from being hurt once again. Bringing Idris back. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? Learning that she has to actually 'grow up' and realize that she doesn't have to take every little thing on herself. That she can be strong, but she doesn't have to be if there are those willing to help. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? :woozy: Other people not dying. From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? She's no thaumaturge, but she does learn how to take advantage of her voice and knowledge as much as she can. She learnt fighting styles from Idris, and how to properly hold a knife, but she How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Learning from Idris, she's taken her charismatic personality and pushed it further. She's diplomatic, she's deceptive, and of course she can perform. Living on her own, she's been forced to learn how to subsist on the natural world. How does your character view themself? How do others view your character? She thinks she's... okay? She tries really hard! She's doing her best! But she's just... okay.\nChatty, pushy, but overall a nice kid. Needs to figure out what she wants to do in life; she has so many years ahead of her. Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? Edicts: Take the Long Road: Take a long-term perspective in all aspects of life. Uncover the hidden value of every trinket. Anathemas: Forsake Collaboration: Disdaining teamwork, refusing to learn from others, or acting solely for individual glory. Judge worth by surface shine. Rely on others to fight your battles Those she trusted abandon her, they refuse to help her in the resurrection of Idris, or they actively hurt her after she has helped them.

Same as he's always done: getting by by selling junk and useless trinkets to those who don't know any better. Why won’t they go back to doing that as soon as they escape? He's actually started to understand the junk he's collected can work well in a pinch. Sure, he could go back to selling junk, but why would he do that when he can actually get away with collecting stuff that actually works? Maybe he could actually find the break he's been looking for. Where are they from? <br>Here and there. It's hard to get an answer from him about it sometimes, but those who really push could probably figure he's from some little settlement at the southernmost coast of <a data-href=\"Welterglow\" href=\"places/avasoryd/welterglow/welterglow.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Welterglow</a>. Probably. Who were they to the community they were from? Local conman pedaling mostly fake \"magic items\" with a penchant for getting into trouble he really shouldn't be getting into. Mostly known for being able to sweet talk his way out of the worst of it. Who is their closest person? Where is that person right now? <br>His apprentice, <a data-href=\"Cecylia\" href=\"npcs/former-pcs/cecylia.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cecylia</a>. She's a young elven tiefling woman, around 19 y/o, with. He picked her up up not too long ago when she tried to scam him. They've become quite close, and he sees her quite a bit like family. She was out on a trip to a town in central <a data-href=\"Barrenbreak\" href=\"places/avasoryd/barrenbreak/barrenbreak.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Barrenbreak</a> when he got taken; for all he knows, she thinks he's dead or has decided to leave her.\n<br>A distant cousin from <a data-href=\"Ravenyard\" href=\"places/avasoryd/ravenyard/ravenyard.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ravenyard</a>, <a data-href=\"Ryker Maddox\" href=\"npcs/ryker-maddox.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ryker Maddox</a>, who he's met and touched base with a couple of times. He's a good man, mostly, running a small company of bodyguards for hire. He's likely still there, if he hasn't taken up his next job. What’s the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Beyond being captured and being experimented on by the wizards? The first time he got caught for selling someone a faulty piece of junk. He was only fourteen, voice cracks and all, and people trusted him. Heavily, in fact! He had that sort of trustworthy face. But he'll never forget the way that customer's face was distorted in rage as they chased him through the streets. He still chuckles thinking about it. Why do the wizards think they can get away with experimenting on your character? He's already such a willing test subject for the weird and the strange, though he didn't exactly expect his pedaling of totally legit \"experimental\" items would get him locked up in some wizards' test dungeon. Oops, that's his bad. How long have you been captured by them? Not long; probably six months at the best, a year at the worst. Time really blends together in there. What kind of experiments have they been conducting on you? Mutagens, magical items, and experimental talismans, mostly. The kind where you really don't want to be on the receiving end of; he's faced a good chunk magical backlash, but that's just allowed him to take the time to copy it all to memory and turn them back against those who captured him. How is this reflected by your class/background/mechanical choices? Thaumaturge collect the strange and turn it to their advantage. At level 2, I'll be taking the Talisman Esoterica feat to start being able to make talismans he remembers from the testing and using them to his advantage. What’s your characters goal beyond simply escaping? Expanding his occult knowledge to better understand why these things work the way they do. Additionally, he really wants to figure out what the end goal of all this experimentation is; he knows he's not the only one being experimented on, and frankly, he has some choice words and perhaps a punch to throw to whoever thought this all up. What do you, as a player, want to get out of playing this character narratively? I'm going back to my sleezey secrets era &gt;:3 but really i wanted to create a character who could theoretically be idolized later in stories, but those who know him know he's kind of a shitty guy. What do you, as a player, want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? i wanted to try something new! perhaps try a mix of mostly ranged martial with the ability to support + i wanted to mess around with familiars! From a story perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? theoretically, he could have been a rogue, but his fascination with the occult was far greater than his wish to \"legally take and sell\" things. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Deception being the highest for him... tracks the most with his conman tendencies. Thievery being his 2nd highest shows that he's not particularly the most trustworthy around potentially valuable items. How does your character view themself? How do others view your character? Reliable. A friend to those in need. A bit overly excessive at times, but who isn't? :)\nFull of himself. Sleezy. A nice guy at the best of times, a selfish asshole at the worst. Does still try his best when it comes down to it, but gods, must it really be when it comes down to it? Describe your characters moral or ethical beliefs. What would have to happen for them to go against their morals? Theft and dishonesty are a natural part of life. If either happen to you, you shouldn't be upset about it. The weak should be left alone; if you're picking on those who don't deserve it, you're worse than they'll ever be. Make him feel bad; not emotionally, he's been called far too many names to count. Torture or, at the very least, threaten bodily harm when he can't get away and you've got your man.

Skies","icon":"","description":"SPOILERS\nPersonally Questions What would your character be doing if they were not on this adventure? Probably searching the coast for the suitable thing or information to prove that she's \"all grown up\" now. She's been mapping the weather, sketching down animals and plants she sees, in the hopes that she finds that \"just right\" proof that she's worthy of being a druid. Why did they choose to take this boat? It’s not the first ship going out, it’s the first one headed south. It is not clear if there’s land in this direction. It's a learning experience, and it didn't want to miss out on what could be nature that adapted to a land different than it's home. She wants to prove to her old druid summoner that she's capable of using this life given to her for good, and if not, she'll be another addition to the nature of this new land. This boat was chosen specifically because she'd been in the area and it has some connections to her swashbuckling friends. Where are they from? She was created from a small, flowering lotus pond not too far off the coast of <a data-href=\"Amberreach\" href=\"places/avasoryd/amberreach/amberreach.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Amberreach</a>. She came into her own person, and not a familiar, after traveling with her druid summoner for a long while. She found she quite enjoyed the life on the sea, surrounded by the Swashbuckler Society. Who were they to the community they were from? The little chipper flower leshy that was a bit too nosey for what it's able to do. It's eager to learn, but it's more interested in the sea around the boat than the actual boat itself. What has been the most impactful moment in your characters life so far? Falling overboard after goofing around too much. As scary as diving into the water was, she found that floating on the waves, surrounded by a new aspect of nature she had yet to experience was comforting. She almost tried to dive back in when they fished her out! What’s your characters goal? Learning as much as it can about the world the crew is sailing into, tracking as much of this and gaining life experience as it can until it's certain that the people that watched it come into it's own would be proud of who it's become. <br>What is your characters relationship with the <a data-href=\"Swashbuckler Society\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Swashbuckler Society</a> and the <a data-href=\"Maronda Shipping Company\" href=\"misc/groups/maronda-shipping-company.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maronda Shipping Company</a>? It essentially \"grew up\" on one of the Swashbuckler Society's ships. Sunny's basically known sea-life longer than living on land. From a narrative perspective, why is your character the class they are? Why aren’t they any other class? Narratively, she's following in the footsteps of her original summoner. How do your highest skills reflect your characters personality? Medicine, Nature, and Survival all show that she is conscious of the environment around her and willing to protect it. It's happy to patch up her friends and those who have shown they're good to be around. Describe your characters personal edicts and anathemas. Come up with a situation where they would to go against these beliefs. Edicts: Record Natural Phenomena: Observe and keep a record of natural phenomena, animal behavior, plant growth patterns, and weather changes.\nOffer comfort in words - healing is more than physical.\nExperience the physical world.\nTake the Long Road: Take a long-term perspective in all aspects of life. Anathemas: Pollute the air, allow those who cause major air pollution or climate shifts to go unpunished.\nDespoil natural places, consume more natural resources than you require to live comfortably, teach the Wildsong to non-druids.\nDisturb Sacred Silence: Disrupt the natural silence of sacred groves or natural sanctuaries. For her to go against these beliefs, she would have to literally come to terms that she's going to go against some of the things that were drilled into her as she learnt how to be a druid. Player Questions What do you want to get out of playing this character narratively? I'm hoping to have a sweet &amp; goofy little guy who ends up growing into someone who can be relied upon to help when you need it most. What do you want to get out of this character from a mechanical/gameplay perspective? Ideally assist my buddies with healing, the occasional support spell, and some whammy elemental damage.

The settlement on the island is surrounded, perhaps unsurprising, by a blue wall. It is debated among northern scholars if the wall is literal, magical, or even metaphorical.Only those with express permission are allowed entry to the city. Others are left outside the walls where the islands curse sickens them or driven away by the Nereid protectors of the area. The island used to be a part of <a data-href=\"Netherrim\" href=\"places/avasoryd/netherrim/netherrim.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Netherrim</a>, but was cursed just the incident that led to the Netherrim wastes. Only a select few families being able to live upon it. It is unclear how the city provides itself with food and water, considering most crops are subject to the curse as well. Oddly enough, sometimes visitors are allowed on the island but there reports are must different than those of errant curse resistant family members. People presumed dead or missing have lived there many years, thought to be completely gone, only to suddenly return on a ship escorted by Nereids.Oddly enough, creatures of the opossum family are plentiful on the island. There are five main families that have freedom to enter and exit Bluewall.<br>The first is the <a data-href=\"Kanok Family\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kanok Family</a>. Long ago, they escaped the desolate lair of a Spirit Naga and fled to the island.

His great evil cursed them, causing them to emit sot-like smoke. They aren’t welcome in many other countries and found Bluewall the only place they could live comfortably. Any Sylphs, regardless of ancestry, who manifest this strange miasma are happily adopted into the family. Children born of this family who do not find themselves covered in cloying fog are quickly sent off the island. <br>The <a data-href=\"Olaf Family\" href=\"misc/groups/olaf-family.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Olaf Family</a> is descended from a clan of <a data-href=\"Azoicmound\" href=\"places/avasoryd/azoicmound/azoicmound.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Azoicmound</a> alchemists and brewers. Their ancient founder was accused of plotting against the core tenants of the country and her entire family was to be sent to death. They escaped and fled to the island, willing to risk its curse only to find they were not affected by it.<br>Lastly, there are the water dwelling <a data-href=\"Maelstrom Family\" href=\"misc/groups/maelstrom-family.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Maelstrom Family</a>. Originally from <a data-href=\"Levinea\" href=\"places/avasoryd/levinea/levinea.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Levinea</a> , their ancestor fell in love with one of the Nereids who lived near the cursed island.

They preferred wizards specifically, because of their versatility. They were not treated fairly in most courts, more as commoner tools to achieve a means to an end. They were encouraged not only to serve their noble lords without question, but to fight and die for them.Around the year 200AC, several noble lords brought their mages with them to a clandestine meeting in the east of the country. At this fateful meeting, the mages were left to their own devices while the Lords drank and made merry, the tradition of wizards being anything less than loyal servants long forgotten, it struck these individuals that the mages they’d been fighting on behalf of their lord were actually the same as they were. Not evil, but pressed into service.These individuals stayed in contact, building networks of court mages. Then, one fateful day, almost all of the court mages in the country revolted. They cut the county clean in two with ease. Claiming the area known as Fallencall for themselves.The attitude of elevating mages from the common people bled into the very foundations of Fallencall. With their newfound independence, the wizards chose to rule above the common people. They separated the country loosely, giving territory to each powerful mage who participated. The mages had no higher authority to answer to, nor any duty to the villages the country happened to swallow up. This lawlessness granted them the freedom to live as they pleased, but also lead to chaos and confusion for those without aptitude for magic.Almost immediately, the wizards descended into infighting. Using powerful magic to exact their rules on other mages and fighting against other mages. Use of the Wish spell particularly was prevalent in this period. The fighting ravaged the country, changing its very geography and leaving it quite unusual and broken up. When it was down to a handful of the most reasonable or strong wizards, they met together and decided upon a set of accords. If one wizard were to violate the rules, they would face retribution from all the other ruling wizards. This included banning of the wish spell for uses beyond the recreation of other spells.Aside from following the provisions, each wizard was free to rule his land and his people as he saw fit. Wizard Lords often raise apprentices out from the common folk, while being careful not to teach them too much. Eventually, one of their apprentices becomes as strong and more clever than they are, and they’re replaced. The new Wizard Lord is then free to reshape his domain as he sees fit.Most Wizard Lords keep their populace healthy and educated, understanding it is in their best interest. Some do not care, using people for cheap labor and discard them, preventing them from escaping through arcane means.

Of course, no such proof of this exists in the current day. Apparently, winning the war required every Chosen of the time to join together against them. Many of the events of this war are likely more metaphorical than factual. For example, their Iron War Titans were likely Giants wearing plate mail.At the end of the war, the entire region was desolated, the fertile soils and teaming corral reefs completely wiped from the map. This is likely due to a combination of factors, including soil erosion and other natural phenomena. It seems equally unlikely that a war could truly have this destructive power.Those that survived the war formed a number of separate clans or tribes in order to survive in the wasteland. Due to its complete lack of resources and defensive positions, no pre-existing country claimed a stake in the land. This area was dubbed the Netherrim Waste around 0 BC.

The <a data-href=\"Raven King\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Raven King</a> raised soldiers from the darkness and swept through almost all of the North, his territory bounded only by the Dwarven mountain tribes to the South, the ancestors of the <a data-href=\"Lunahelm Raiders\" href=\"places/avasoryd/lunahelm-raiders/lunahelm-raiders.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lunahelm Raiders</a> to the West.

Scholars hotly debate this fact as he did not appear in public nor remove his mask for a great deal of that time. During his rule, he slowly parceled off sections of his land to his children, allowing them to take their mother's name and append his surname - Jūn (君), meaning ruler.Each direct child of his formed their own noble house, with the intention that the eldest of descendants would serve on a ruling council. There were over 30 recognized noble families at the time of the Raven King's abdication. The ensuing wars and infighting significantly weakened the country. Over the last millennia, this number has steeply declined. The mage revolt of the 200s also caused a high number of families to lose their lives, titles, or territories.In the current day, there are approximately a dozen noble families in good standing. They oversee the country with minimal public infighting. They follow a feudal system, leasing land to the peasantry. The quality of life of the average common person is dependent on the current lord's benevolence, although most of the wiser lords remain wary that their power is dependent on their people not rising up in anger.

Bodies with a Mark of Crime—be it from Willowshore, another village, or <a data-href=\"Lung Wa\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lung Wa</a>—can only be buried in this overgrown and unkept area. While graves were unmarked in the past, a few wooden posts have been erected recently and paper shuriken hung off them, seemingly in silent protest that the ones buried beneath might have died an unjust death. Or perhaps this is an attempt to stave off the rise of a bitter, vengeful ghost.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":["places/willowshore-hinterlands/specterwood.html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/willowshore/bones-of-the-forgotten.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761419054335,"modifiedTime":1761419105204,"sourceSize":956,"sourcePath":"Places/Willowshore/Bones of the Forgotten.md","exportPath":"places/willowshore/bones-of-the-forgotten.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":300,"backlinks":["places/willowshore/willowshore.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/willowshore/ceiba-creek.html":{"title":"Ceiba Creek","icon":"","description":"Links into <a data-href=\"Woodraft Lake\" href=\"places/willowshore/woodraft-lake.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Woodraft Lake</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Body_of_Water"],"headers":[],"links":["places/willowshore/woodraft-lake.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/willowshore/ceiba-creek.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761418684980,"modifiedTime":1761418697012,"sourceSize":60,"sourcePath":"Places/Willowshore/Ceiba Creek.md","exportPath":"places/willowshore/ceiba-creek.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":301,"backlinks":["places/willowshore/ceiba-river.html","places/willowshore/willowshore.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/willowshore/ceiba-river.html":{"title":"Ceiba River","icon":"","description":"Links into the <a data-href=\"Woodraft Lake\" href=\"places/willowshore/woodraft-lake.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Woodraft Lake</a> alongside <a data-href=\"Ceiba Creek\" href=\"places/willowshore/ceiba-creek.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Ceiba Creek</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Body_of_Water"],"headers":[],"links":["places/willowshore/woodraft-lake.html","places/willowshore/ceiba-creek.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"places/willowshore/ceiba-river.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1761418642473,"modifiedTime":1761418684203,"sourceSize":90,"sourcePath":"Places/Willowshore/Ceiba River.md","exportPath":"places/willowshore/ceiba-river.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":302,"backlinks":["places/willowshore-hinterlands/willowshore-hinterlands.html","places/willowshore/dock.html","places/willowshore/willowshore.html","places/willowshore/woodraft-lake.html","sessions/seasons-of-ghosts/session-4.html"],"type":"markdown"},"places/willowshore/ceiba-duyue-exchange.html":{"title":"Ceiba-Duyue Exchange","icon":"","description":"When Governor <a data-href=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/heh-shan-bao.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Heh Shan-Bao</a> took office in <a data-href=\"Willowshore\" href=\"places/willowshore/willowshore.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Willowshore</a>, he ordered several new warehouses and a trade office to be built here, hoping to expand the town’s industry and connection with the coastal fortress of <a data-href=\"Karahai\" href=\"places/karahai.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Karahai</a>.

To the northeast stand the burnt-out ruins of an abandoned roadhouse once known as <a data-href=\"Canary Inn\" href=\"places/willowshore-hinterlands/canary-inn.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Canary Inn</a>, while a remote <a data-href=\"Hunter’s Hut\" href=\"places/willowshore-hinterlands/hunter’s-hut.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hunter’s Hut</a> stands near the headwaters of the Duyue River. To the north can be found an old expansion once intended to support Willowshore, but these buildings and farms were soon abandoned when it became apparent the stream that flowed through the area tended to dry up at random intervals each year. To the west, near the source of the Ceiba River, are the remains of the old <a data-href=\"Lumber Camp\" href=\"places/willowshore-hinterlands/lumber-camp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lumber Camp</a> abandoned a few years ago by the local lumber lords—a location that’s slowly being reclaimed by the forest.

Wildlife is abundant with deer and boars making up the primary large game in the region, and more dangerous predators like black bears, wolves, giant stag beetles, and enormous spiders comprise the greater perils of the hinterlands to those who travel too far from the roads or explore the wilds after dark.\n<br><a data-href=\"Canary Inn\" href=\"places/willowshore-hinterlands/canary-inn.html\"

dragged by the townsfolk\nLook around, things seem strange Straw mats and red blindfolds seem a lot more dirtier than yesterday\nAlso, when we went to sleep to wait for the “rescue”, we’re pretty sure it was a different part of the woods\nAlmost like we were dragged to a different part of the woods in the middle of the night\nDragged from the northish, lot of marks around the clearing, things are surprisingly stirred up Its technically not mandatory for them to deliver the food, sometimes the deliverer gets hungover and doesnt show up and thats “escaping from kidnappers” instead of being

particularly strange, he follows his word\nIt seems as though some kind of fight occurred here between a number of people who seem to have been chased off by something that looks like a person walking on stilts? It left circular poles as it chased them away This seemed to be some sort of giant. 8 legged creature Slightly before we arrive at the bridge, hear some strange rustling swiftly approaching form the bushes\nCentipedes :( That can speak???\nExperiencing rage\nCentipedes are getting more and more articulate as the fight goes on\nSuper unusual for centipedes to be in the daytime and should also be running away after we killed the 1st centipede in combat\nSeems like the influence of some kind of evil spirit, they have unusual intellect, are aggressive and malicious 10 mins since we woke up, instead of nice summer weather we were expecting, a very strong fog rolls in\nBy the time the river is in sight, its affecting ability to see\nNotice strange shapes moving and shifting around our vision, but when we look, theres nothing there\nShizuka and kavi remember a nursery rhyme <br><img alt=\"monday (1).png\" src=\"attachments/monday-(1).png\" target=\"_self\"> <br><a data-href=\"Spider Gate\" href=\"places/willowshore/spider-gate.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Spider Gate</a>!

Dense fog but not HORRIFYING dense fog Kavi convinced someone carted the spider away, it headed east and then went into the river. Didnt go to the bridge, went to the river\nEastern watchtower 1/5th mile later, smells like blood, 2 towns guardsmen are dead, other 2 are bluegrey humanoids that were slain by swordblows\nGuards died to snakebites to the legs, the humanoids are gremlins\nSeems to have happened night/early morning\nUp in the guard tower, a woman peers down at us Alive or dead?\n“Alive. Are you alive or dead?”\nAlive\n“Recite 4 of the practices of the season of ghosts to prove you arent more monsters in disguise”\n“You might wanna check on your families, ive been hearing- be cautious going back. Ive been hearing screams and roars, other unsettling sounds have been echoing all night. Since well after midnight, before the fog even showed up .since dawn, things have been completely silent.”\nShe gives us feather token, a crossbow, and then more lantern oil As we approach, blood begins to seep up from the earth, turning the area into sucking gorey mud Despite the blood-soaked mud clinging, we can step off before it sucks us down\nBlood of those who died in the area is bubbling up from the earth When within 100ft of the bridge, theres fresh blood For the first time, the stone lantern is extinguished\nA Large man is sitting on a makeshift throne, people are putting on a show of the deaths of people who recently died\nMaking merry so loudly, we dont need to actively sneak past because of how heavy the mist is and how loud they are\nThere have been some boats beaten in and purposefully destroyed <br><a data-href=\"Cloud Paper House\" href=\"places/willowshore/industrial-district/cloud-paper-house.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cloud Paper House</a> is empty No signs of a struggle, seems like they left in a hurry\n<br>Hastily written note that says <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Matsuki Shou\" data-href=\"Matsuki Shou\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/matsuki-shou.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Matsuki</a> on it <br>There seems to be some lights on at the <a data-href=\"Matsuki Estate\" href=\"places/willowshore/matsuki-estate.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Matsuki Estate</a>, hard to notice bc it seems theyve been dimmed Some protective lanterns lit <br>At <a data-href=\"Eternal Blaze Ironworks\" href=\"places/willowshore/eternal-blaze-ironworks.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Eternal Blaze Ironworks</a>, its swiftly abandoned Odd that sister would leave workshop messy\nMade sure it wasnt gonna burn down At graveside manners, note “There has been an attack, go to any walled buildings.” <br>Go to <a data-href=\"Matsuki Estate\" href=\"places/willowshore/matsuki-estate.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Matsuki Estate</a> Recite ghost rules\nMiller lets us in\nEntering the estate, there are a lot of people in here, including <br><a data-href=\"You So-Jin\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/you-so-jin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">You So-Jin</a>, makeshift med station\n<br><a data-href=\"Yong Wu-Xiu\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/yong-wu-xiu.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yong Wu-Xiu</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Kawaka Myna\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kawaka-myna.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kawaka Myna</a> <br><a data-href=\"Yong Wu-Xiu\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/yong-wu-xiu.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Yong Wu-Xiu</a> checks in on zhu, so frightened\nWe were gone for a day but what a day\n“Yeah normally waking up an hour or 2 late is no big deal.

We tried to bury what was left but… as we were all sworn to secrecy, we had no priest to do any of the proper rituals, we did our best to find their skeletons amongst the remains and bury them. As they burned, the main fugitive cursed the governor, and seeing as you saved me… perhaps that might be… good to know, i guess?

Maybe they possessed the governor? IDK” Hi prisoner Whats involved in the ritual “It lasts a couple days, and i thiiink i saw some chanting? They’re pretty protective of the ritual area.” You havent seen it? “Its right by the camp.” But you havent been involved? “No, but they have a big alter.” Thats kind of pathetic, isnt it? “The alter should be bigger?” No, killing people and not even being allowed onto the site <br>“IDK. i still dont know if i agree more with <a data-href=\"Zhuo-do\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/zhuo-do.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zhuo-do</a> or <a data-href=\"Mujiro\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Mujiro</a>. I can see why they might not like a fencehopper-” Mujiro? “He wants us all to leave the camp and destroy the city.” So youre middleground? “I like being outside the camp. But also, going to the promised land seems pretty good.” It seems weird that you think the promised land exists “Of course it does” How do you know? “she said it exists. And what would the wall of fog be anyway?” A curse “For you all.” Are you not affected?\nWe met a guy who went through the mist, he didnt say anything about the promised land “Maybe it goes different places for different people” What happens if you die before you do the ritual? “I assume that i’ll be reborn.” Only you, or can all shapechangers go to the promised land? “I think all? Even non shapechangers. But you might not like it.” Whats so good about it “Many faces to steal. Many things to mimic, itll be normal to mimic things. Many challenges for those who enjoy the killing and stabbing. We will be with the powerful Creator. So. y’know.” Is this in a way not the promised land? “I guess. But IDK if there will be jails int eh promised land.” Yes for traitors. I killed a guy last week.\nIf the promsioed land lets you kill freely, whats to stop you from being killed\nHow many are involved in the ritual? “4 or 5. They switch out. Not many of those in the camp are good at stealing faces. Let alone cast arcane magics. Zhuo-do are the only one who can do divine abilities.”\n“Zhuo-do read his aura and said he was very old.” Youre still believing her? “Yeah. and i ahev to decide between killing and sacrificing. But its my firmly held belief that one of these is the right thing to do.” <br>Do you believe that <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Kugaptee\" data-href=\"Kugaptee\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kugaptee.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the god</a> will protect the people int he camp? “Those worthy, surely.” Then why not have a quick selection, we go there, we die, and only the worthy are left “You can go there. Are you not familiar with the area?” I am <br>“Oh its the <a data-href=\"Lumber Camp\" href=\"places/willowshore-hinterlands/lumber-camp.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lumber Camp</a>.” Whats worthiness? “He’d say you were worthy. I bet he’d like you on his side. You have a great evil within you.” How many are in your camp? “Like 20?” In the camp or altogether? “In the camp.” How many outside? “We keep having some wander in from the woods, i wanna say like 30? I certainly have trouble believing im the only one in town.” Know anyone else seeking the promised land? “I suppose he’ll be in the camp. The old man. The farmer man.” Do you know whats going on with the people that nobody seems to remember? “I mean. Maybe. The people around them got very scared when people took their face off and forgot?” No, theres empty houses Oh boy zhu has a plan How are you doing “Fine.” Would you like smth to drink “...sure” Give him a bottle\nSomething thats fun when youre passing time, try to balance smth on your head if you would be so kind\nHopefully im not too drunk for this- (needle darts at the bottle)\nKeeps handing him bottles to do this\nDo you- here, i know you want to take a swing at me. Everyone does. “Uh not really.” Listen. I want to continue this game, its fun to drink until i miss. But TBH i dont want to be the one to kill you “Why?” Your friends will do it for me. As you can tell, i am very drunk rn. I came upwith this plan while drunk, so all magic will reveal im truthful\nYou already talked, you gave us info, so youll coordinate with us sooner or alter “Wdym” Answer some questions\nWho exactly has been replaced that you know of? <br>“The old farmer (<a data-href=\"Kum Soon-chong\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kum-soon-chong.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kum Soon-chong</a>.

(divine lance actually aiming at him) “Theres a group northside, but we’ve intentionally not told each other.” Do you know what happens to those who are sacrificed? Those who fail are stuck to people like me. “You have more ghosts than we have sacrificed” You remember reincarnation. What makes your cycle different? “I didnt think i had enough of a soul to be a ghost” You do “So ill be around forever.” People killed by me will be attached to me. Do you think your voice will be understood amongst the others? “Itd be fun” I mostly pee and masturbate, its not fun “I dont do either” You dont urinate? “No, i drink thru my hands and it leaves thru the soles of my feet. How else would it be?” Your patron. Shes a divine caster. Does she have a symbol? “Yyyyes.”\n“She has a book she carries with her at all times. She has… theres of course the shrine. She has a red butterfly?” Ive seen a few of those before.\n(yeah shes a witch. AP overwritten)\nWill you be kind and forthcoming about all of the abilities. Your shapechanging is fine, very seethrough, but fine. Could you tell me the abilities in the camp have before we go there? “Well. stealing faces. Zhuo-do steals part of your identity too? It takes a piece of your soul or smth. Its disorientating having your face stolen, but when its done by her- its additionally disorientating. She has a knife. Also a twisted piece of wood is the symbol.” Whats the meaning of the butterfly “They come out of the wall sometimes? She says theyre an important creature….” You dont know what meaning is, do you “Theyre red and theyre butterflies, they come from paradise, maybe theyre messengers, speak to her.”\nTheres a bloodthirsty guy but not as powerful as zhuo-do <br>Leave, go grab <a data-href=\"Kazuma Oono\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/kazuma-oono.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Kazuma Oono</a> “What brings you my door so late!

They had a hut for hunting, if hed be anywehre in town, he’d be there. There’s no way to go, but its probably he went north, past the old village expansion\n“He probably went that way, that’s where teh hut is.. Maybe theyre staying there for the night, thats where the old inn is too Has he been talking abt a trip “Nooo, because he stopped bringing that little book that he’d read all the time so I figured he kind of accepted his fate of being stuck here forever like the rest of us but hey maybe not” awesome.

Yeah, they ran into some kind of twig spirit that tried to kill them/attack them, after that they couldnt tell north from south.”\nThey had some direction issues, where were they attacked?\n<br>“Headed up north?

The love of my life is dedicated to letting you figure things out. She’s dedicated.” We’re stuck in a cycle of life and death we’re aware “If you want to make a deal with the ghosts theres a nice tree for you.

What is it? “She sure does A-ying.” So shes a fey? We cant know her name? “I mean, if you really want… well no, i should still have a shred of loyalty, let her do her whole guardian spirit thing.” Is she the goddess that put us in this? Thanks for letting us know its a goddess “There are many forces at play, we’re all together in this… with our lord. Our fiendish master. Not all of us have accepted out fate. I have plenty of time to bring her over.” What if she never does “There’s only so long someone can hold out.” How long has it been already? “Since the tree was planted. Shed been in there… a thousand years, at least a hundred since collecting… hundred 60. Big monastery with a lot of dead monks and woodcutter.” Dont understand what sort of game youre getting at. Seems like youve seen us before? “Ive never seen you make it this far before, never get past the wall. I may not have to chant my way out.”\n“It takes a long time to do, depends on whether your fresh blood is enough to awaken him or not”\n“I guess some of you dont have fresh blood.” Do you? “No.” Then i dont want to hear you talk “I need the blood to be reborn in a real body than be in this decrepit awful thing.”\nShe seems unconcerned\nShe could hear the message\n“The thing is, im not even here. Again i really hoped you enjoyed the creatures along the path” Are you going to say something interesting? “I can leave I suppose” Zhu throws ignition at the illusion\nIt doesnt go through, but see her make a blasphemous sign “That was… didnt mean to do that.” You can counteract divine magic? “Maybe so. There is one true divinity. Its not whatever you follow.”\nShe is dispelled by the spell, but she can come back\nKavi guiying zhu feel unwell as we begin to recall our own past deaths. Not necessarily from this body. Especially guiying. Her face seems like 3 different ones, he sees 3 distinct familiar but unplaceable. Except one. That is one he got visions of during the week of meditations\nZhu gets throwing himself in the river but being dragged out by the ghosts\nKavi has recollection of loving families and dying surrounded by grandchildren, farming the land, studying in a library with oldman hands scratching against paper as they write their theories down, deaths are unfulfilling, wanted more, none are as violent as what guiying and zhu are experiencing.\nShizuka has very few human memories, paws and wings, other such forms. Seems when she reincarnates that she has enough karmic debt to be knocked back down into a non-speaking sentient form. As though some curse prevents her from understanding/achieving the next step of enlightenment. G: i know you..\n“Yeah :)” Ive seen you a lot “Is that as far as youve gotten? I forgot how shit of a monk you are.” How many lives have i met you…? “Well. three important ones.” (guiying feels heartache wrt her)\nHave i.. Hurt you in the past? “Oh what a question. Not in any way that matters.” Wdym? “You are an insignificant footnote in my grand history. A rebound if you will.” Were we… lovers? “[laughs] ohhh. In a life. What a mistake. Well grief blinds you to all sorts of things.” What about the other 2? “The other 2?” What were you to me? “Ohh. i suppose a friend for one. A mentor, i guess, for the other.” What did we start as? “Travelling companions. When we were both intact of soul, in not these awful bodies.” What did we end as?\nZhu: dead. What does it matter? “Well said. And we will die again. And you will only get worse.” Z: i do have a theory. Hundredth’s time the charm. Lets take care of this.

Uh. where did you get those… we’re hiding from the creature that eats. Where did you get those beads?” Down the way, why? They were sold to me by a merchant “No, they were my sister’s… is she okay?” I didnt see any signs of struggle, may have been a common thief “Where is she??” She mightve gone to town “No we were going this way!” Maybe she went to get help, there was a beast “Oh, i suppose that makes sense, ill keep waiting for her” We’ll find her (message to us: we’ll have to kill this one on the way out)\nWhat does the beast eat? “It eats doors? And corpses?” (kavi thinking ghoul? But wait its wood, maybe its related to woodcutters that came here? Creatures dont normally eat doors. Sense in their heart that this thing is pretty nasty.

The tomes were here. Nothing else here? You dont remember the important thing that was here?” Huh? “If you dont remember, how would we remember?” There are many important things here, you have to be more specific “Why dont you come all the way in?

Theyre very expensive.

Im sure you know theyre trying to talk to you.” Zhu: they mostly just scream “That would be my friend. Um. it seems my friend, they may only speak to you when you’re close to their domain, which doesnt help with working together.” The tentacle shark gets rowdy\nWheres the alcohol? “I expect there to be some in the kitchen if a creature hasnt over taken it.” G: can you tell us more about the fiend tree? <br>“Well. a thousand years ago. <a data-href=\"Tan Sui-Jin\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/tan-sui-jin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sui-Jin</a> gave her life in a fight with a powerful fiend, she had many allies by her, and they were not successful in their attempts to permanently kill the fiend. They… she passed away fighting the fiend. She turned herself into a tree, under which the fiend is buried. Recently something has changed since- at the start of the summer, the grave was cracked open, reanimating the monks, though im privy to history i cannot leave, only listen at the walls, that is what ive gathered. If you have any questions about what happened before my death, im happy to answer.” G: Tell a bit more about me? I read the letter you sent my mother. I know something happened, but i cant remember everything. Confusing “It might be best that way.” G: Thats what my mother said too. I dont understand. “Its pretty straightforward. Just live a normal life. And then, in your next life, start thinking back on the horrors. You dont have to risk it and keep spiraling. You can stop here.” G: im already far beyond a normal life, i’d say. “So? You assume youre in karmic debt from the nature of your creation, i dont think its accurate.” G: what do you think? “I think you can life a normal, happy life in the confines in the cycle of reincarnation.” G: i plan to have a happy l;ife, id like to understand the past. I already ran into someone who knew me “Ill help you to free the town, but after you should leave, you’ll keep running into them. They’ll keep making you worse.” G: how will they make me worse? “You can pause on your path to enlightenment for one life instead of sinking lower.” Z: we paused for a hundred lives “Its still the same one!”\n“Wait. how do you know that?” Z: hints\n<br>G: explains the situation abt <a data-href=\"Xin Yue\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/xin-yue.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Xin Yue</a> “Oh yikes. Her other half is gonna be mad about that. I cant actually purify the shrine myself. But if you did and returned it to its spot in the garden, you can talk to the founder of the monastery who is stuck in the tree. By restoring the shrines you can speak to her briefly. She’s going to be mad you were give too many hints. I suppose. Not that shes trying to keep you in the dark. It seems an awfully difficult thing to come to grips with.” G: we just want to help the monastery “For sure.” Z: we’ve died a hundred times, nothing has changed, why not try something new? “I’ll give you my notes… i just dont think we need to get into guiying’s rap sheet.”\n“Have you noticed that we’re all dead? Have you thought who could be responsible? Its her. Shes an awful bitch. Think in your heart if you want her to make you worse.” K: has this happened multiple times? “YES.” G: how can i make amends for a life i cant remember? “BY BECOMING A FARMER. I will. Tell you somethings. I would like you to purify the statue.” Z: you’re old. Presumably. “Yes.” Z: the people have town have forgotten. What gods have been forgotten? “The fiend.” Z: but the fiend isnt the one that did this im sure. If he did, his presence would be in town, wouldnt ahev to send envoys. “Damn it. If i wasnt stuck in this room. I think, and again this is before we were resurrected, whoever fucked around with the tree and let the fiend rise as a god, the 3 who were in the tree at the time would remember, i think my lingering ghost heard a ritual occurring but…”\n<br>“Theres a door that leads to a garden, that leads to stairs, down which leads to the base of the tree. I wouldnt recommend going down there til you have gotten the aid of <a data-href=\"zhi hui\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/zhi-hui.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">zhi hui</a>. But if you’re confident…”\n“if - whichever is the most responsible before giving to guiying, thatd be great.” Long ass journel entry, but she makes it nagaji so guiying cant read it, diary of her past lives “I… do not judge me for what ive done in my past. Ive atoned for each day. More than a handful will know the shame. Do you have any questions about the monastery? You can also rest here.” Z: do you have an armory? “Noo storage room. There was a nice shield hung up on the walls near the shrine recreating the tree?” G: if we’re able to purify the shrine, will you be able to move to your next life? “Once the danger is gone, ill be able to move on.” G: you deserve a good life. A happy one. “Ill take a rain check, and when you recall yourself, you can say it again if you believe it.” G: um. Uh. do you know where zhi hui is? “Well. aforementioned shrines. She’s found within the tree. But restoring the shrines will give her the power to manifest again. The entire monastery is her domain?”\n“Theres one right here, youd have to bring it back to the garden. Theres a recreation of the tree, a statue of jian’soo, and a statue of a deer. Itd probably take 10 mins of prayer to purify the statues?” Uhhh so the statues head “Reattaching should be fine? Then purify?” Go through the garden “Hello there!”\nOh god wtf is that A fiend of glutteny. A nindoru, fiends that are separate from reincarnation. Can manifest objects from thoughts “Welcome to my dormitory!”\n“Are you in search of a shrine? A statue?” Yes “The deer?” Its one we’d bargain for “My stomach is empty, ive been filling it with the stone, id be willing to regurgitate it for you. Maybe a pound or two of your flesh? Just an arm.”\n“Im quite enjoying having this artifact in my stomach, but i miss human flesh more. I dont want to fight if you’re willing to trade. Just a hand or foot.” Theres a beast out there? “Its not living!”\nOk combat\nOk we get the deer statue\nPut it back to the pedestal 10 mins Zhi hui “Excellent, thank you, i… appear before you… very weakened…. Thank you, its been so long since ive been able to see beyond the tree. I can remain long enough to answer 1 question of me, there are other statues.” Z: what happened to the tree? Who are the other people? <br>“Trapped with me are <a data-href=\"Tan Sui-Jin\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/tan-sui-jin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sui-Jin</a>, <a data-href=\"Xin Yue\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/xin-yue.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Xin Yue</a>, the fiend kugapte.

His attempt, it backfired, and cracked open the grave, plunging us all into a mindscape. I… cannot see how many years we’vve repeated the cycle, but i know something has changed outside.

But after the monastery was founded, zhi hui lived to an old age and passed away, xin yue discovered that their soul didnt return back to <a data-href=\"Lady Jansoo\" href=\"misc/gods/seasons-of-ghosts/lady-jansoo.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lady Jansoo</a>, it had become sealed within the tree. To communicate their love, they had to to communicate with the tree. As soon as zhi hui accepts that kugaptee is correct, they will be reborn in a new body. But until then, their soul shall be trapped within the tree alongside <a data-href=\"Tan Sui-Jin\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/tan-sui-jin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sui-Jin</a>.” Pedestal Some kind of fox was on it\nZhu recalls that it would fit the statue the librarian tried to get us to take Dead tree Shrine that just needs to be purified\n10 mins\nCreature howls in agony Try to grab the statue head, big plan Tree comes to life, trying to frighten and panic guiying\nDouble nat 1 wow Go grab that fox statue\nWe get 2 questions for this We were wondering about kugapte, how he formed? That is an interesting question. I hate to it, but we dont fully know. I can tell you how the first- what he is? What type of demon, and how the first one was formed, but the specifics of him and an xui jin’s rivalry are unknown. If that would give you something to work with. Yes pls Hes a type of fiend called a nindoru, they form the corruption of the cycle of reincarnation. When a mortal is taken from the cycle of reincarnation and corrupted, it becomes a nindoru. Break cycles, hide their true faces, they look and act undead though they are alive. Each is a type of cycle from a natural world or social tradition and most importantly, they eat the souls of those who have reincarnated multiple times. But they don’t take the whole soul. They take pieces of you away, especially those who are about to ascent to true enlightenment, they shred the soul and send you back to the sea of enlightenment, but you are no longer complete. They’re the greatest threat, most abhorrent, its possible when your soul is shredded, you could be so incomplete that you reincarnate into one of these creatures. <br>Before the war that ate the gods, when ascending/losing deific status was easy, these fiends amassed and lost followers quite swiftly. The first nindoru fiend, it is said, was a human child born to samsaran parents. They felt it would be best for the child to live among humans to recall and learn and go thru the process as one should, but as he learned of his true heritage, instead of feeling grateful to be raised among humans he felt rejected, upset. They hoped that he would live harmoniously and reincarnate back into a samsaran in his next life, but he became angry and resentful. His name was <a data-href=\"Sigek\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/sigek.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Sigek</a>. <br>Became bitter against all those that were reincarnated, demanded to know why life was only achievable thru and arbitrary karmic cycle, became obsessed with achieving perfection beyond the cycle of life and death, worked for a lich, the lich tells him about a soul cage that helps him achieve this. He couldnt accept vulnerability so he turned on his master and kept him in the soul cage. He travelled and spoke to others of likemind, around the time of the slaughter in the heavens in which <a data-href=\"lord Jiyong\" href=\"misc/gods/seasons-of-ghosts/lord-jiyong.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">lord Jiyong</a> was executed at the behest of judge <a data-href=\"Lady Yaojun\" href=\"misc/gods/seasons-of-ghosts/lady-yaojun.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lady Yaojun</a> and so became obsessed with undeath and reincarnation. After many years his sizeable congregation perhaps with the backing of lord jiong, he created a ritual written in his records that would shatter the wheel and free us all from the cycle of life and death. After that no one saw him or his cult, they went in to perform the ritual and didnt emerge. Later that year, the 1st of nindoru fiends appeared, and around this time the most powerful of them appeared, sigek and kugapte. Its unknown their relationship, is sigek took his name or took his soul. They claimed the ritual was a gateway that always existed. Its possible in the age of gods that the cycle really did get broken <br>(oh god cliffnotes from <a data-href=\"Elizeth Candora\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/elizeth-candora.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Elizeth Candora</a>. Part of this is taken from pathfinder lore, touchstones. 3 judges, theres a Court of Silence, known to many a scholar, during the war in which the gods were eaten, they realized this creature, something before the gods was lost to time, bc they were very involved, they were messing shit around, throwing divine energy out at an irresponsible level. Someone, angry, created a creature that fed off this energy. The more they got involved, the bigger it got, until it could eat planets. They had to call in the non-divine extraplanars to get assistance (no devils, demons, angels, axiomites, etc) like the elementals perhaps. Whole thing, they fought, theological importance. They got pretty far. To slow him down, in the middle of the godeater war, the gods (100s to thousands) retreated back to the outer planes. They formed a council of deities that could minorly influence the mortal realm. The 30 on A’s pinterest are the ones that known to exist, at least said they were here. Kind of a. Symbol of death = someone has complete influence over that domain. Some deities have a domain, some have multiple. Dragon lady head of the pantheon, golden, had a husband. Husband had a twin brother, the night killed the moon to get the sun, she ordered the execution of the night (jiyong) they came back from the dead, they represent reincarnation. Jiyong represents undeath)\nOk not a major god, most likely a local god or someone who had a taste of divinity\nWhat could be helping him get this sort of power? Well. there are a number of ways that he could be helped, but the first is that he is in combat with tan zui jin and he’s asleep (unlikely). To my understanding, the things youve seen outside of the monastery comes from unconscious recollections We did see his butterflies Hm. but did you see anything such as the tree in this yard. People we cant remember He certainly has an influence over the entirety of this area. We have encountered those worshipping him <br>There is likely, on the otherside of this trapped base, he has a very powerful quajin. Xin yue, they create rituals to bolster him. At some point, a man with spiritual ownership of the town conducted a ritual- (the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" data-href=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/heh-shan-bao.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Governor</a>) it seems as tho in doing this and putting the down on the line, thought he was going to exorcise the demon and get more influence, may have put the town spiritually in the ownership of this demon, which is a very powerful thing for a demon to have. There is also in some ways, your own spirits unintentionally feeding the continuation of this terrible nightmare Wdym? Because weve been thru so many cycles? Yes and the moment it continues, your governor sought to bolster the tree and instead cracked the grave of the fiend. He grows in strength, various people have come here to stop him. He had less influence at the start Does he just keep doing this cycle? Yes, xin yue has been cycling and chanting and without his followers sensing his presence have returned to bolster him. If only there was a way to revoke ownership from the governor <br>We need to go outside to the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Sze\" data-href=\"Sze\" href=\"places/sze.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">capital</a> and get one of us to become the governor If you can find some way to make yourself interact with the outside world, that would certainly help things considerably. The governor also has brought himself into his own separate mindscape, not on purpose, along with his house. It might be there where you can find him to ask him questions about how he learned this ritual/magic We go fight sojiruhs\nCleanse the statue\nWhoaaaa the monastery is restored\nWater is pure, no longer any scary reflections\n“I may now manifest anywhere in the monastery, if you are in need of any healing or spells, i can do that for you.”\nGo to the basement Murder basement\nSacrificed prisoners\nTreasury, normally symbolically empty but its not\n<br>On the wall is the shape of a great <a data-href=\"Tan Sugi Tree\" href=\"places/willowshore-hinterlands/tan-sugi-monastery/tan-sugi-tree.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sugi Tree</a>\nGo down the hallway\nRoom of blood\nPool with 4 fingers and a thumb\n“Good you finally arrived to exchange your flesh and blood to kugapte, but you should be honored to be chosen for such a role.

I’ll think about killing myself but I want to kill one of you first Why do you think working for the demon that your lover killed would bring her back? “My lover didnt, my lover died in that fight. Guiying and i sucked ass and ate shit.” You fuck up once and make it better “Are you doing that?” Yeah “Can you do that? You undead freak?” Youre one to talk “Which is why i want my real body back.” So what do you monks do. You dont seem very studied in common “We did destroy the library, so literacy rates are low.”\n“Im not necessarily not dying so i can read tomes. Ive read the tomes.

Does she even feel any regrets? (Mostly a probe to see if she still has emotions or if Kugapte is suppressing them. Less for her more for us to have a signal to look out for.) <br>I think perhaps establishing this monastery was a mistake, I thought we might work together to strengthen the <a data-href=\"Tan Sugi Tree\" href=\"places/willowshore-hinterlands/tan-sugi-monastery/tan-sugi-tree.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sugi Tree</a> and protect <a data-href=\"Tan Sui-Jin\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/tan-sui-jin.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tan Sui-Jin</a>’s legacy. I should have known our enemy of one thousand years might have plans equally long in the making. Is this even his mindscape or are we in something greater's mindscape? This monastery is not his mindscape, he has slumbered in his own dreams beneath this tree for much longer than we. <br>How does Kugapte have a perfect memory of <a data-href=\"willowshore\" href=\"places/willowshore/willowshore.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">willowshore</a> if it is his mindscape. He does not, you do. If this is to be one of the anchors of the plain, why is it allowed to change? It shows signs of decay and change far more than the 4 months we've been in the loop, let alone you remembering the cycles. The mindscape reflects metaphor and memory, in this case it also reflects the condition of the monastery as it has become since my passing. Did we die when entering into the dreamscape what of our bodies in reality? We must hold hope you were transported here completely. Have you been able to cultivate power across cycles or does that reset whenever the reset happens?

We remained in balance until this cycle. Will want to know about his past for sure, does she know anything about his past lives from before her death? Does she know about why he ended up this way? How he died? What he did? I know, but to tell you would be to deprive you of your spiritual journey. I could summarize a tome, but it would not be the same as reading it. Will want to know about what to expect from this fight. They’ll have to fight her lover and kugapte, anything to look out for? The fiend may offer you boons to turn to its side, pray do not listen. Only the enlightened and saint has truly resisted his corruption, a priestess almost enlightened with one spark of doubt could not. What does she want from this fight. This is her lover after all and he can respect that she presumably still cares for her. Is there a way to cleanse xin yue’s soul and help her? Is that what zhi hui would want? <br>A fiend in hell might one day reach enlightenment, but she who believes herself outside the cycle must first meet <a data-href=\"Lady Jansoo\" href=\"misc/gods/seasons-of-ghosts/lady-jansoo.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Lady Jansoo</a>’s judgement. <br>thoughts on the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" data-href=\"Heh Shan-Bao\" href=\"npcs/seasons-of-ghosts-npcs/heh-shan-bao.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Governor</a> and what he did that caused this to happen (insert probing about how the mayor was totally stupid, he couldntve done all this himself, etc,) (trying to get more information out of her on what the mayor did to have all this be the outcome of that snowball) I passed on far before the governors arrival in this town, you will have to find him, or whatever is left, and ask.

But if you're short on rice, I'm sure a handsome young man will be able to replace that.” A lot of her behavior is a young woman exerting power, but in this case, these rules will apply to every single town in the country.
